You’re on the right track splitting “POS workers” vs “support workers” and using permissions + defaultScreen; the main gaps now are consistency, safety, and weird cross‑role combos.[1][2]

## How to organize roles

Instead of top‑to‑bottom by feature, define a **matrix**:

- Axes: authentication (clock in vs POS login), cash handling, order/ticket handling, adjustments/voids, reports, configuration.[2][1]
- Each role is a row that picks a minimal set in each axis:  
  - Barback: clock in, own tips, own shift report; no POS login, no cash, no voids, no customer data.[1][2]
  - Server: POS login, open/close checks, accept payments, adjust own tips, limited reports.[2][1]
  - Bartender: like Server, possibly drawer access, limited void/discount.[1][2]
  - Manager: full POS access, overrides, wider reports, some config.[2][1]
  - Admin/Owner: everything, including backend settings, integrations, accounting.[1][2]

You can still group privileges visually (Security, Access, Function, Discount/Comp, Reports, Events, etc.), but **roles** should be defined business‑logically, not by the UI section they live in.[2][1]

## Edge cases you’re likely missing

### 1) Clock‑in vs POS access

- Users who can clock in but must never see POS (barback, host, expo, kitchen).  
  - Ensure: `clockin anytime` or time‑clock API allowed, but `POS login allowed` and `pos.access` are off.[1][2]
  - Double‑check direct URL hits (you already do `/orders` → `/crew`; consider doing the same for other POS routes like `/kds`, `/tabs`, `/payments`).[2][1]
- Users who need to **clock in at POS only** (fingerprint, no stand‑alone web clock).  
  - Make sure fingerprint‑only flags don’t block them from the Crew Hub if they’re non‑POS.[1][2]

### 2) Cash handling and drawers

- “Barback never touches cash” must be enforced by removing:  
  - `open drawer \ no sale`, `assign drawer to other employees`, `open any assigned drawer`, `accept cash transactions`, `reverse cash transactions`, `start bank entry prompt`, `batch close`, and any drawer/till reports.[2][1]
- Users who accept payments but must be **blind** to totals:  
  - Use “prevent user from seeing sales/payment info with their drawer” style permissions where available.[2]
- People with `paid outs` but no other cash permission – decide if that’s allowed or must be manager‑only.[1]

### 3) Tips, comps, voids, and refunds

- Separate “can **enter** tips” vs “can **adjust** tips”, and “own” vs “others”.  
  - E.g., server can adjust their own tips, manager can adjust anyone’s.[2]
- Restrict: `delete/void order`, `reverse credit transactions`, `reverse custom tender transactions`, `load / refund gift cards`, and heavy discounts to manager roles, and enforce `void reason required` or `void type required` globally.[1][2]
- Make sure non‑POS roles that see the Crew Hub **cannot** see tip or commission reports for others unless they are supervisors.[2]

### 4) Reports exposure

- Distinguish:  
  - “My shift report” vs “employee report (view all)” vs “daily sales / labor / timesheet / customer / event reports”.[1][2]
- Barbacks/support: only “own” shift/commission.  
- Servers/bartenders: maybe their own shift + basic daily sales summary (no sensitive breakdown).  
- Managers: all POS reports.  
- Admin: full POS + back‑office (inventory, accounting, invoicing, events, integrations).[1][2]

### 5) Backend / settings bleed‑through

There’s a ton of backend/host/config permissions (menu, discounts, events, accounting, payments, host mode, completed tickets, delivery, etc.). Common pitfalls:[2][1]

- Host/Expo roles:
  - Likely need `Access Host Mode`, `Access Completed Tickets`, but **not** `Access to All Tickets` or “Manage tickets” globally unless intended.[2]
- Do not give front‑line roles:
  - Menu editing, disable product (86), global printer settings, delivery/online menu publishing, events/catering setup, accounting setup, gift/local, card processing, integrations, etc., unless they’re managers/admins.[1][2]
- If you allow `disable product (86'd)` from POS, check if that should be only bartender/manager, not every server.[1]

### 6) Ticket and table handling

From the second system: `Manage tickets`, `Transfer Tickets to Self`, `Transfer Tickets to Others`, `Make Payments`, `Change Item Quantity`, `Resend Printed Items`, etc.[2]

Edge concerns:

- Hosts that can open tables but should not collect payments.  
- Staff that can transfer tickets to themselves (OK) but not to others (prevents “stealing” tables).[2]
- Staff that can reprint checks but **not** reprint credit card slips (to avoid abuse).  
- Limits on `Change Item Quantity` and `Resend Printed Items` so kitchen doesn’t get duplicate or hidden items.[2]

### 7) Authentication / security details

- Fingerprint only vs PIN: ensure combination of `login to POS through fingerprint only`, `clockin/out through fingerprint only`, and `POS login allowed` cannot strand an employee (e.g., allowed to clock in but not to log in anywhere).[1]
- `auto-logout after sale/send action` + “No Auto-Clockout at Last Known POS Use” interactions – test that support staff are not being auto‑logged or clocked out oddly.[1]

### 8) Special flows and “start shift” behavior

- You added `defaultScreen` plus `pos.access` gating; also check:  
  - KDS route, delivery/driver screens, payments‑only screens.[1][2]
- Ensure non‑POS roles never see:  
  - Floor plan, `Start Your Shift` drawer count, bank entry prompts, batch close, or any cash reconciliations.[1]

## Priority ordering of privileges (for UI and mental model)

Instead of strictly top‑to‑bottom POS vs payments, group by **risk**:

1. High‑risk: cash, refunds, voids, discounts, tip adjustments, gift cards, card processing settings, accounting.[2][1]
2. Medium: ticket management (transfers, holds), menu 86, reports beyond own shift, delivery/online menu publishing, events management.[2][1]
3. Low: clock‑in/out, view own shift/tips, access host mode, view completed tickets.[2]

Then decide for each role: what is the **highest risk level** they should ever touch, and never assign privileges above that.

## Concrete checklist for you

When you define or audit a role, walk through:

- Can they log in? Where do they land (Crew vs POS)?  
- Can they clock in/out? How (PIN, fingerprint)?  
- Can they see floor plan / tickets / KDS? Which ones?  
- Can they touch cash or drawers in any way?  
- Can they make or reverse any payment type?  
- Can they comp/discount/void, and with what reasoning requirements?  
- What reports can they see (self vs others vs business)?  
- Do they change configuration (menu, printers, integrations, events, accounting)?  

If you want, I can take one role at a time (e.g., Barback, Server, Bartender, Manager) and propose a minimal exact permission set using the lists you pasted.




help me think this through, giving the employees the right access based on user roles and privilages,  What edge cases am i missing? SHould I organize the employee roles from top to bottom, SUch as pos privilages, then payment privilages, Can clock in but doesnt have access to the pos to ring up sales view tabs etc?  

Context                                                                                                                                                                      

 Currently ALL employees — including barbacks with only tip/commission permissions — get routed to /orders after login, see the full POS floor plan, and get prompted to
 "Start Your Shift" with a cash drawer count. Barbacks never touch a cash drawer. They need a simplified landing page with only their relevant options: time clock, tips, and
  shift report.

 Key Insight

 The pos.access permission cleanly separates POS employees (Server, Bartender, Manager) from support staff (Barback). The hasPermission() utility already handles wildcard
 matching (admin → all permissions).

 Changes (4 files, 1 new)

 1. Login API — return defaultScreen (1 line)

 File: src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts

 Add defaultScreen: matchedEmployee.defaultScreen || null to the response object (~line 93). Currently this field exists in the schema but is never returned.

 2. Login Redirect — check pos.access before routing

 File: src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx

 Modify getRedirectPath() (~line 23-35):
 - Accept permissions from the employee object
 - If employee lacks pos.access → return /crew
 - Otherwise continue with existing defaultScreen logic (/orders, /kds, etc.)
 - Add 'crew' as a valid defaultScreen switch case
 - Import hasPermission, PERMISSIONS from @/lib/auth-utils

 3. Orders Page — guard redirect for non-POS employees

 File: src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx

 Add a useEffect after permissionsArray is computed (~line 98):
 if employee exists AND has no pos.access → router.replace('/crew')
 This catches direct URL navigation. Import hasPermission, PERMISSIONS.

 4. Crew Hub Page — NEW

 File: src/app/(pos)/crew/page.tsx (new ~200 lines)

 Simple glassmorphism page with:
 - Header: Employee name + role badge, current time, Logout button
 - Action cards (2-col grid, permission-gated):
 ┌───────────────────┬───────────────────────────┬────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────┐

 - Uses existing useAuthStore for employee data
 - Uses existing /api/time-clock/status and /api/time-clock endpoints (same as login page)
 - Glassmorphism styling: dark background, bg-white/5 border border-white/10 backdrop-blur-xl rounded-2xl cards
 - No ShiftStartModal — barbacks don't handle cash drawers

 What Does NOT Change

 - ShiftStartModal — non-POS employees never reach /orders, so they never see it
 - TimeClockModal — already reusable, may optionally be used from Crew Hub
 - Auth store — permissions[] already stored
 - Prisma schema — defaultScreen already exists on Employee
 - Existing POS flow — all POS employees (pos.access) work exactly as before

 Verification

 1. Login as Barback (PIN 9999) → should redirect to /crew, NOT /orders
 2. On /crew → verify Time Clock card, Tip Adjustments card, My Shift, Commission cards visible
 3. Clock in from /crew → verify works without drawer count
 4. Manually navigate to /orders as Barback → verify redirect to /crew
 5. Login as Demo Manager (PIN 1234) → should still go to /orders as before
 6. Login as Server (PIN 2345) → should still go to /orders as before
