# Orders Domain - Change Log

## 2026-02-26 — Bartender Testing Fixes (`a4ac377`)

### Split Order Table Release
- When all split children are paid, parent order's table is now freed to `available` status
- Previously only `order.tableId` (child's) was checked — split children have no `tableId`, so parent table stayed occupied forever
- Added fire-and-forget table update + snapshot cache invalidation after `parentWasMarkedPaid` socket dispatch

### OrderPanel Tablet Fix
- Added `minHeight: 0` to items scroll container — payment buttons now visible on 768×1024 viewports
- Without `minHeight: 0`, flex child wouldn't shrink below content height, pushing footer off-screen

### Shift Modal Flash Fix
- `useShiftManagement` now persists `currentShift` and `shiftChecked` in `sessionStorage`
- Page reloads read cached values on mount instead of re-triggering shift start modal
- Clearing shift (logout) clears both storage keys

## 2026-02-24 — Online Checkout, Combos, Bar Tab & Order Fixes (`743e618`)

### Online Checkout
- Server-side modifier pricing, `deletedAt` filters, `onlineSettings.enabled` check, `onlinePrice` support, quantity validation
- Dedicated system employee for online orders
- Soft-cancel on payment failure (order not abandoned)
- Rate limiter added to checkout endpoint

### Online Menu
- `deletedAt` filters applied to online menu queries
- `onlineSettings.enabled` check gates menu visibility
- `onlinePrice` included in menu response payload

### Combos
- `deletedAt` filters on combo queries
- 86/availability checks enforced on combo components

### Combo Inventory Deduction Expansion
- `order-deduction.ts` expanded to walk `ComboTemplate` components for inventory deduction

### Void/Waste Combo Expansion
- `void-waste.ts` expanded to handle combo item voids
- `pourMultiplier` applied during void/waste deduction
- Spirit substitution via `modifier.linkedBottleProduct`

### Bar Tab Cancel Fix
- Clear `savedOrderId` on card decline to prevent stale tab references

### Duplicate Adds Fix
- `isTempId` filter prevents duplicate item creation
- `lastMutationRef` guards against re-processed mutations
- Modifier cache prevents redundant modifier fetches

### Seats Disappearing Fix
- `baseSeatCount` preserved in panel select to prevent seat loss on panel switch

### Batch Adjust-Tip
- Recalculates total, increments version, writes ledger entry, dispatches socket event

### Timed Sessions
- `minimumCharge` enforcement on timed session settlement

### Comp/Void
- Entertainment status toggle on comp/void (sets `available` or `in_use`)

## 2026-02-23 — Wave 1 Go-Live Safety (Skill 422)

### K1 (HIGH): Voided Items Stay on KDS
- Voided items remained visible on KDS until next full refresh — no socket event dispatched
- Fix: Added `kds:item-status` socket dispatch with `voided` status after item void
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/comp-void/route.ts`

### K2 (HIGH): Resent Items Don't Reappear on KDS
- Previously bumped items resent to kitchen were invisible on all KDS screens — no socket event
- Fix: Added `kds:item-status` socket dispatch on resend
- File: `src/app/api/kds/route.ts`

### K3 (HIGH): Un-Bump Doesn't Sync Across KDS
- Un-bumping on one KDS screen didn't notify others — item showed different states on different screens
- Fix: Socket dispatch for bump, serve, and status change events syncs all KDS screens
- File: `src/app/api/kds/expo/route.ts`

### ST2 (MEDIUM): previousOrder Not Cleared on Logout
- `previousOrder` in order Zustand store not cleared on logout — next employee could see stale data
- Fix: Clear `previousOrder` in `clearOrder()` and all 3 logout paths (manual, idle timeout, session expired)
- File: `src/stores/order-store.ts`

---

## 2026-02-23 — Chaos Test Fixes (Skill 416)

### Bug 5 (CRITICAL): Order Number Race (Duplicates)
- Concurrent order creation could produce duplicate order numbers — no atomicity on number generation
- Fix: `@@unique` constraint on order number + transactional number generation with retry on conflict
- Files: `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`, `prisma/schema.prisma`

### Bug 7 (HIGH): Items Duplicated During Send
- Items in `pendingSavesRef` appended again to bgChain during send, creating duplicates
- Fix: Filter `pendingSavesRef` items from bgChain append
- File: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts`

### Bug 8 (HIGH): No Socket Listener for Active Order
- Active order hook had no `orders:list-changed` listener — cross-terminal edits invisible
- Fix: Added `orders:list-changed` listener with own-mutation skip
- File: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts`

### Bug 9 (HIGH): Discount Doesn't Recalculate
- Percentage discount stayed at original dollar amount when items added/removed/voided
- Fix: `recalculatePercentDiscounts()` called on all subtotal-changing operations
- Files: `src/lib/order-calculations.ts`, `src/app/api/orders/[id]/items/route.ts`, `src/app/api/orders/[id]/comp-void/route.ts`

### Bug 10 (HIGH): Empty Drafts Accumulate
- Tapping a table created a draft; navigating away left empty drafts in the database
- Fix: `clearOrder()` soft-deletes empty drafts (zero items, no payments) on navigate away
- File: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts`

### Bug 11 (HIGH): Deleted Items Not Dispatched
- Deleting an item dispatched no socket event — other terminals showed stale data
- Fix: Added `dispatchOpenOrdersChanged` on item delete
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/items/[itemId]/route.ts`

### Bug 13 (HIGH): Multiple Drafts Same Table
- Rapid taps from multiple terminals created multiple drafts for the same table
- Fix: Table lock (`FOR UPDATE`) inside the creation transaction
- File: `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`

### Bug 17 (MEDIUM): Course Firing No Ordering
- Courses could be fired in any order — kitchen confusion
- Fix: Prior-course check ensures earlier courses are fired first, with `force` override
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/fire-course/route.ts`

### Bug 18 (MEDIUM): Quantity 0 Accepted by API
- Item update API accepted `quantity: 0`, creating ghost items
- Fix: Validation rejects `quantity < 1`
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/items/[itemId]/route.ts`

### Bug 19 (MEDIUM): Orphaned Seats No Warning
- Removing a seat silently moved items to shared bucket — no indication to server
- Fix: Response includes `movedItemsToShared` count + socket dispatch
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/seating/route.ts`

---

## 2026-02-23 — Split Payment, Void & Merge Fixes (Skill 415)

### Bug 4 (CRITICAL): Fractional Split Modifiers Price=0
- When splitting an item with fractional quantities, modifiers had price set to `0` instead of proportional amount
- Fix: Proportional modifier pricing — `price * (splitQty / originalQty)` preserves correct ratios
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/route.ts`

### Bug 5 (HIGH): Parent Totals Stale After Child Void
- After voiding an item on a split child, parent order totals were not recalculated
- Fix: Sum all sibling split children's totals and update parent inside the transaction
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/comp-void/route.ts`

### Bug 6 (HIGH): Missing Socket + Cache on Unsplit Merge
- Merging split children back into the parent dispatched no socket events or cache invalidation
- Fix: Added `dispatchOpenOrdersChanged`, `invalidateSnapshotCache()`, and floor plan update
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/route.ts`

### Bug 7 (HIGH): Split Merge Race (Payment Between Check/Delete)
- During merge, a payment could be processed on a split child between check and delete, causing data loss
- Fix: `FOR UPDATE` locks on all split children inside tx + re-check that no payments snuck in
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/route.ts`

### Bug 10 (MEDIUM): Missing Cache Invalidation on Split Delete
- Deleting a single split child did not invalidate snapshot cache or update floor plan
- Fix: Added `invalidateSnapshotCache()` and floor plan table status update
- File: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/[splitId]/route.ts`

---

## 2026-02-23 — Order Disappearance Fixes (Skill 414)

### Bug 1 (CRITICAL): Draft Promise Race
- Rapidly clicking between tables triggered overlapping `POST /api/orders` draft requests; stale responses overwrote the active order
- Fix: `draftGenRef` generation counter in `useActiveOrder.ts` — stale draft POST responses are discarded if generation has changed
- File: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts`

### Bug 4 (MEDIUM): Version Conflict Loads Wrong Order
- A 409 version conflict triggered a refetch, but if the user had switched tables, the refetch loaded the wrong order
- Fix: Active-order guard in `order-version.ts` — only refetch if the 409's `orderId` matches the currently active order
- File: `src/lib/order-version.ts`

### Bug 5 (MEDIUM): 409 Adoption Missing Version Sync
- When `POST /api/orders` returned 409 `TABLE_OCCUPIED` and the client adopted the existing order, no version was synced, causing immediate 409 conflicts on next mutation
- Fix: Server includes `existingOrderVersion` in 409 response; client syncs version on adoption
- Files: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts`, `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`

---

## 2026-02-23 — Payment UX & Safety Wave 1 + TABLE_OCCUPIED Fix

### Send to Kitchen UX (Skill 413)
- 3-state Send button: Idle -> Sending... -> Sent! (1.5s green flash)
- bgChain failure revert: items marked unsent again on background send failure
- Button disabled during send to prevent double-tap

### TABLE_OCCUPIED Client Recovery (Commit 2931b18)
- When `POST /api/orders` returns 409 `TABLE_OCCUPIED`, client adopts the existing order instead of failing
- `ensureOrderInDB`: loads existing order, appends local items, shows "Joined existing order" toast
- Fixes client-side handling for walk-in table lock introduced in A+ Polish sprint

### Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts` — 3-state send status, bgChain failure revert, 409 TABLE_OCCUPIED adoption
- `src/components/orders/OrderPanelActions.tsx` — Send button visual states

---

## 2026-02-20 — Sprint Sessions 8-14: EOD Auto-Close, Stale Orders Manager, Item Discounts, Glassmorphism, Kitchen Context Lines

### T-077 — EOD Auto-Close
- `businessDayDate` logic added to `eod-cleanup` job to correctly determine which orders belong to the closing business day.
- `eod:reset-complete` socket event emitted after cleanup so all connected terminals update.
- `FloorPlanHome` shows a dismissable EOD Summary overlay after the reset event is received.

### T-078 — Stale Orders Manager
- New page at `/orders/manager` listing stale/open orders with age indicators.
- Force-close and assign actions per order row; both emit socket updates on completion.

### P2-D01 — Item-Level Discounts
- `itemDiscountAmount` field added to `OrderItem` schema.
- Manager PIN gate required before applying a discount to any item.
- Discount subtracted from item price before tax calculation.
- Discount amount shown on receipt line and included in ESC/POS kitchen/receipt print.

### T-016 — POS UI Glassmorphism Lift
- `FloorPlanMenuItem`: `blur` + drop shadow applied for depth.
- `OrderPanel`: `backdrop-blur` + frosted seat headers.
- `CategoriesBar`: blur + border styling for visual separation.
- `ModifierGroupSection`: selection badges updated for contrast.
- `ModifierModal` Special Instructions field: glassmorphism input styling.

### P2-H02 — Modifier-Only Kitchen Context Lines
- Standalone modifier-only orders now include the parent item name as a context line on kitchen tickets and KDS display, so the station knows what the modifier belongs to.

---

## 2026-02-18 — Forensic Audit Wave 6

### Bug Fixes
- **Deleted items reappearing**: Added `where: { deletedAt: null }` to nested includes in 5 API routes (Prisma `$extends` doesn't cascade to nested relations)
- **Ingredient modifications not showing**: Added `ingredientModifications: true` to 5 item-reading queries across 3 API routes

### UX Improvements
- Comp/Void flow reduced from 5-6 taps to 3 (auto-detect, auto-select first reason)
- "Same Again" reorder button on closed order actions
- ÷2 quick-split button in order panel actions
- Clickable seat headers in order panel for seat selection

### Hook Extractions
- `usePaymentFlow` (7 states), `useModifierModal` (5), `useItemOperations` (5), `useComboBuilder` (4)
- orders/page.tsx reduced from ~51 to ~30 useState calls

## Session: February 17, 2026 — Split Combined View, Inline Split Creation, UI Polish (Skills 370-372)

### Summary
Major split order enhancements: combined view shows all split items when tapping a split table, inline split creation from order panel, and item-add guard prevents orphaned items on split parents. Also includes UI polish (button layout changes) and numerous bug fixes for split flow, stale closures, and state management.

### What Changed

#### Skill 370: Split Order Combined View
1. **Fetch & merge child split items** — When tapping a table with splits, all child items fetched from `/api/orders/{id}/split-tickets` and merged into parent order view
2. **Split labels** — Items tagged with `splitLabel` (e.g. "75-1", "75-2") for visual grouping
3. **Purple group headers** — "Check 75-1", "Check 75-2" headers with per-check subtotals in OrderPanel
4. **API response fix** — Corrected parsing from `{ data: [...] }` to `{ splitOrders: [...] }`
5. **Field mapping fix** — Split items need `menuItemId`, `sentToKitchen: true`, `kitchenStatus: 'sent'`, and modifier `modifierId`
6. **Type extensions** — Added `splitLabel?: string` to OrderItem, LoadedOrderData, OrderPanelItemData, InlineOrderItem

#### Skill 371: Inline Split Creation
1. **"+ New" button** — Dashed purple border button at end of split chips row
2. **API creation** — Calls `POST /api/orders/{parentId}/split-tickets/create-check` to create empty child
3. **Immediate load** — New chip added to row, new split loaded for item entry — no screen change
4. **Context preservation fix** — useEffect checks `splitParentId` instead of stale `orderSplitChips` array

#### Skill 372: Split Parent Item Add Guard
1. **Add guard** — Blocks adding items when viewing split parent (`status === 'split'`)
2. **Toast message** — "Select a split check or add a new one"
3. **Flash animation** — Purple pulse 3x on split chips row to draw attention
4. **Two entry points guarded** — `handleAddItem` (orders/page.tsx) and `handleMenuItemTap` (useOrderingEngine.ts)

#### UI Polish
1. **Removed bottom Hide button** — Redundant with top Hide button in OrderPanelActions
2. **Moved Print button** — Now between Cash and Card in quick-pay row
3. **Moved Other button** — Now between Cash and Card in payment buttons row
4. **Hidden seat section** — "Assign to seat" hidden when order has splits (`hasSplitChips`)

#### Bug Fixes (Prior Session, Same Commit)
1. **Status field missing** — Added `status: data.status` to all 3 `loadOrder` callers (FloorPlanHome x2, split-order-loader)
2. **Early return removed** — Split orders no longer skip handleTableTap
3. **Stale closure fix** — handleCategoryClick/handleQuickBarItemClick use useRef pattern
4. **SplitCheckScreen ID fix** — Was receiving child ID instead of parent ID for manage mode
5. **Zustand mutation fix** — Direct tabName mutation replaced with proper `updateOrderType`
6. **Tab name modal cleanup** — State reset on all exit paths
7. **Auto-create deps fix** — Removed viewMode from auto-create order useEffect dependencies
8. **Split clearOrder guard** — Added split status check before clearing order

## Session: February 17, 2026 — Order Types Overhaul, Duplicate Prevention, Bar Send Fix (Skills 366-367, 369)

### Summary
Major order types overhaul: dynamic header tabs from admin config, table selection enforcement for dine_in, on-screen keyboard for kiosk terminals, and bar send flow fixed to prompt for tab name. Also fixed duplicate order creation from rapid send taps.

### What Changed

#### Skill 366: Duplicate Order Prevention
1. **Ref-based send guard** — Added `sendInProgressRef` check at top of `handleSendToKitchen` in `useActiveOrder.ts`. React state `setIsSending(true)` was too slow; multiple taps entered the handler before re-render.
2. **Voided orphaned duplicates** — Cleaned up 2 duplicate orders in NUC database created during testing.

#### Skill 367: Dynamic Order Type Tabs & Table Selection Enforcement
1. **Dynamic header tabs** — `UnifiedPOSHeader.tsx` renders tabs from `orderTypes` prop instead of hardcoded tabs. `dine_in` → "Tables", `bar_tab` → "Bar", others → `ot.name`.
2. **NavTab accent colors** — Per-type hex colors from admin config via `accentColor` prop.
3. **Table selection enforcement** — `FloorPlanHome.tsx` blocks item addition (`handleCategoryClick`, `handleQuickBarItemClick`) when `workflowRules.requireTableSelection` is true and no table selected. Shows "Tap a table to start" overlay.
4. **Order type conversion** — `order-store.ts` `updateOrderType()` supports explicit field clearing via `'in' checks` for tableId/tableName/tabName.
5. **Tables tab active state** — Fixed `isTablesActive` to include `activeOrderType === 'dine_in'` (was only `!activeOrderType`).
6. **useOrderTypes hook** — New `src/hooks/useOrderTypes.ts` fetches order types with `SYSTEM_ORDER_TYPES` fallback.

#### Skill 369: Bar Send Tab Name Prompt
1. **Send shows tab modal** — `handleSend` in BartenderView now shows tab name modal with keyboard when no tab selected (was silently creating nameless tab or doing nothing).
2. **Post-tab send** — `pendingSendAfterTabRef` tracks whether send triggered the modal. After tab creation, items auto-sent to kitchen.
3. **Extracted `sendItemsToTab()`** — Shared helper for send logic used by both direct send and post-tab-creation paths.

### Commits
- `91dd93e` — feat: dynamic order type tabs, table enforcement, order type conversion
- `d22fdc5` — feat: on-screen virtual keyboard for kiosk terminals
- `e67bc1f` — fix: Tables tab not highlighting when active
- `b67d292` — fix: bar send shows tab name prompt with keyboard

### Files Modified

## Session: February 16, 2026 — Split Payment Bug Fix (Skill 356)

### Summary
Fixed critical split ticket payment bug that caused orphaned/unpaid items and potential undercharging.

### What Changed

#### Skill 356: Split Payment Bug Fix
1. **Parent zeroed after split** — Split creation now soft-deletes ALL parent items (not just fractional) and sets parent totals to $0. Parent becomes empty shell with `status='split'`.
2. **Pay route blocks split parents** — Added guard: `status === 'split'` → 400 error. Prevents direct payment of parent's stale totals.
3. **"Pay All" pays children** — Changed from `onPaySplit(parentOrderId)` to `onPaySplit(unpaidSplits[0].id)`. Uses existing `splitParentToReturnTo` payment loop to cycle through all unpaid splits.
4. **Button improvements** — Shows aggregate unpaid total `Pay All ($XX.XX)`. Appears even after partial payments.

### Root Cause
Split creation copied items to children but left originals on parent with stale totals. "Pay All" passed `parentOrderId` to payment — paying the parent's snapshot instead of the actual split totals. Items added post-split were orphaned.

### Commits
- `3219f2a` fix: prevent split parent from being paid directly, zero parent after split

## Session: February 16, 2026 — Single Live Split Board & UI Hardening (Skills 352-353)

### Summary
Unified split ticket system into a single live board with real-time editing. Fixed critical UI bugs in order panel: bare "0" rendering, selection collapse, and TypeScript build errors.

### What Changed

#### Skill 352: Single Live Split Board
1. **Create-check API** — `POST /api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/create-check` creates empty split with next splitIndex (max 20)
2. **Delete-check API** — `DELETE /api/orders/[id]/split-tickets/[splitId]` removes empty split, auto-merges if last remaining
3. **Live board editing** — Card-tap-to-move in manage mode, delete empty checks, "+ New Check" card
4. **Split chips header** — Order panel shows chip buttons per split (with totals and PAID badges) instead of seat strip
5. **Payment loop** — `splitParentToReturnTo` state returns to split board after paying each check
6. **"Pay All" button** — Pays parent order directly when no individual splits are paid yet
7. **Floor plan refresh** — `floorPlanRefreshTrigger` fires on split screen close

#### Skill 353: Order Panel UI Hardening
1. **Bare "0" fix** — `resendCount` (primary), `seatNumber` wrapper, `seatNumber` picker all guarded with `!= null && > 0`
2. **Selection collapse fix** — `useQuickPick` cleanup effect no longer filters sent items, only items removed from order
3. **Layout** — Inline print/delete, hide controls until selected, pointer cursor for sent items with `onSelect`
4. **TypeScript fixes** — Removed `'round'`/`'oval'` from TableNode shape switch, removed unreachable `'split'` trigger comparison in OpenOrdersPanel

### Commits
- `03d5410` feat: single live split board — create/delete checks, split chips header, payment loop
- `dd77c56` refactor: split flow cleanup — remove dead code, add robustness, centralize helpers
- `9e14ed7` fix: refresh floor plan on split screen close so chips update immediately
- `1bbcd75` fix: show split tickets overview after splitting, fix split accessibility
- `7cd8a53` perf: add ?view=split lightweight endpoint, remove redundant reload after split save

## Session: February 15, 2026 — Per-Seat Check Cards & Seat Filtering (Skill 349)

### Summary
OrderPanel auto-groups items by seat into card-style "checks" with per-seat subtotals. Tapping a seat on the floor plan filters the order panel to that seat's items only.

### What Changed
1. **Auto seat-grouped check cards** — When 2+ seats have items, each seat renders as a bordered card with color dot, "Seat X" label, item count, and subtotal
2. **Seat filter bar** — "Showing Seat X" indicator with "Show All" button when a seat is selected on the floor plan
3. **Sent items grouping** — Sent-to-kitchen items also group by seat (at 70% opacity)
4. **Pre-split foundation** — Visual groundwork for future per-seat split payment

### Files Modified
- `src/components/orders/OrderPanel.tsx` — `autoSeatGroups` memo, check card rendering, filter indicator, `filterSeatNumber`/`onClearSeatFilter` props
- `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx` — `useFloorPlanStore` for `selectedSeat`, filter logic

## Session: February 10, 2026 (Per-Item Delay Fix, Held Item Fire, Codebase Cleanup)

### Summary
Fixed critical bug where per-item delay countdown timers disappeared after Send, added Fire button to held items, and completed several codebase cleanup tasks (saveOrderToDatabase removal, alert→toast migration, kitchen print alignment, tax rate wiring).

### Skills Completed/Updated
| Skill | Name | Status |

### Bug Fix: Per-Item Delay Countdown Timers Disappearing (CRITICAL)

**Problem:** After pressing Send on an order with both immediate and delayed items, countdown timers and Fire buttons appeared for a split second, then vanished. Items reverted to showing "starts on Send" instead of active countdown.

**Root Cause:** In `src/app/api/orders/[id]/send/route.ts`, the delayed items detection had a `(!filterItemIds)` guard:
```typescript
// BEFORE (BUG):
const delayedItems = (!filterItemIds)
  ? order.items.filter(item => item.delayMinutes && item.delayMinutes > 0 && !item.isHeld && !item.delayStartedAt)
  : []
```
When client sent `itemIds` for immediate items only (the correct behavior for mixed orders), `filterItemIds` was set, so the entire delayed items array evaluated to `[]`. `delayStartedAt` was never stamped in the DB. The client-side `startItemDelayTimers` set it momentarily, but `loadOrder()` fetched from API with null values and overwrote the store.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const delayedItems = order.items.filter(item =>
  item.delayMinutes && item.delayMinutes > 0 && !item.isHeld && !item.delayStartedAt
)
```
Delayed items are now ALWAYS identified and stamped regardless of whether `filterItemIds` is provided.

**Server log before fix:** `delayed: 0` despite 2 items having `delayMinutes` set
**Server log after fix:** `delayed: 2` — both delayed items correctly identified

### Feature: Fire Button on Held Items

**Problem:** Held items showed a red "HELD" badge but no way to release and fire in one action.

**Solution:**
1. Updated `handleFireItem` in `useActiveOrder.ts` to detect held items and release the hold via `PUT /api/orders/{id}/items/{itemId}` (set `isHeld: false`) before firing to kitchen via `/send`
2. Added inline Fire button to the HELD badge in `OrderPanelItem.tsx` — appears as `HELD [Fire]` on the item row
3. Toast message distinguishes: "Held item fired to kitchen" vs "Delayed item fired to kitchen"

### Codebase Cleanup (5 Parallel Agents)

| Agent | Task | Files | Impact |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| saveOrderToDatabase removal | Replaced deprecated function with direct order-store calls | `useActiveOrder.ts`, `order-utils.ts` | Eliminated dead code path |
| Alert→toast admin pages | Replaced alert() calls in admin pages | 9 admin page files | 22 alert() → toast() |
| Alert→toast POS+components | Replaced alert() calls in POS and shared components | 9 POS/component files | 22 alert() → toast() |
| Kitchen print alignment | Created shared `kitchen-item-filter.ts` | `send/route.ts`, `print/kitchen/route.ts`, new `kitchen-item-filter.ts` | DRY: shared filter logic |
| Tax rate wiring | Wire tax rate from location settings to order store | `useActiveOrder.ts`, `order-store.ts` | Tax rate from DB instead of hardcoded |

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/send/route.ts` | Removed `(!filterItemIds)` guard on delayed items filter |
| `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts` | `handleFireItem` supports held items (release hold → fire), saveOrderToDatabase removal, tax rate wiring |
| `src/components/orders/OrderPanelItem.tsx` | Added Fire button to HELD badge |
| `src/lib/kitchen-item-filter.ts` | NEW: shared `getEligibleKitchenItems()` filter |
| `src/lib/order-utils.ts` | NEW: utility functions extracted from useActiveOrder |
| `src/stores/order-store.ts` | TAX_RATE removal, temp ID update |
| Multiple admin pages (9 files) | alert() → toast() migration |
| Multiple POS/component files (9 files) | alert() → toast() migration |

## Session: February 10, 2026 (Real-Time Table Updates & Stability Fixes)

### Summary
Comprehensive session fixing real-time table status updates, auth stability, ghost data cleanup, and accidental virtual combine prevention.

### Changes

#### 1. Auth Hydration Guard (orders/page.tsx)
- Added `hydrated` state + `useEffect` pattern to prevent Zustand store from redirecting to `/login` before localStorage rehydration completes
- Auth redirect now checks `hydrated && !isAuthenticated` instead of just `!isAuthenticated`
- Render guard checks `!hydrated || !isAuthenticated || !employee`
- **Root cause:** Auth store `partialize` was only persisting `locationId` — fixed in previous session to persist all auth fields, but the hydration race remained

#### 2. Complete Socket Dispatch Coverage (Cross-Terminal Table Updates)
Added `dispatchFloorPlanUpdate` and `dispatchOpenOrdersChanged` to ALL order lifecycle events. Previously only `POST /api/orders` (create) and `POST /api/orders/[id]/pay` (payment) fired socket events — major gaps existed.

| Route | Event | Floor Plan | Open Orders | Status |
|-------|-------|------------|-------------|--------|
| `POST /api/orders` (create) | order created | ✅ existed | ✅ existed | — |
| `POST /api/orders/[id]/items` (add items) | items added | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ **NEW** | Fixed |
| `POST /api/orders/[id]/send` (fire to kitchen) | sent | ✅ existed | ✅ existed | — |
| `POST /api/orders/[id]/pay` (payment) | paid | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ existed | Fixed |
| `POST /api/orders/[id]/close-tab` (close tab) | tab closed | ✅ **NEW** | ✅ existed | Fixed |

#### 3. Instant Local Table Status Update (FloorPlanHome)
- Added `useOrderStore()` to FloorPlanHome to watch `currentOrder.items.length`
- When items are added to a table order, immediately calls `updateTableStatus(activeTableId, 'occupied')` — no server round-trip
- Cross-terminal updates handled via `orders:list-changed` socket listener (already existed from Skill 248)

#### 4. FloorPlanHome Socket Listener for orders:list-changed
- Added second socket subscription in FloorPlanHome: `subscribe('orders:list-changed', ...)` alongside existing `floor-plan:updated`
- Both trigger `loadFloorPlanData(false)` (background refresh, no loading state)
- Added `OrdersListChangedEvent` interface to `src/lib/events/types.ts` and added to `EventMap`

#### 5. Ghost Tables Cleanup (Database)
- Identified 8 old seed tables (IDs: `table-1` through `table-8`) with `deletedAt IS NULL`
- These co-existed with real CUID-based tables, appearing as phantom tables on the floor plan
- Soft-deleted all 8: `UPDATE "Table" SET deletedAt = datetime('now') WHERE id LIKE 'table-%'`

#### 6. Virtual Combine Long-Press Threshold (TableNode.tsx)
- **Problem:** 500ms long-press threshold too short — users accidentally entering virtual combine mode on normal taps (especially touchscreens)
- **Fix:** Split threshold by context:
  - **POS view (non-editable):** 1200ms — much harder to trigger accidentally
  - **Editor view (editable):** 500ms — responsive for drag/combine workflows
- Also skips `onDragStart()` in POS view since tables shouldn't be draggable

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx` | Hydration guard (useState + useEffect) |
| `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanHome.tsx` | Instant table status, orders:list-changed socket listener, item preservation fix |
| `src/components/floor-plan/TableNode.tsx` | Long-press threshold 500→1200ms for POS view, skip drag in POS |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/pay/route.ts` | Added dispatchFloorPlanUpdate on payment |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/close-tab/route.ts` | Added dispatchFloorPlanUpdate on tab close |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/items/route.ts` | Added dispatchOpenOrdersChanged + dispatchFloorPlanUpdate on item append |
| `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` | Added dispatchFloorPlanUpdate on order create (when tableId present) |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/send/route.ts` | Added dispatchOpenOrdersChanged + dispatchFloorPlanUpdate on send |
| `src/lib/events/types.ts` | Added OrdersListChangedEvent interface + EventMap entry |

### Bugs Found / Fixed
1. **Pay route missing floor plan dispatch** — When table order paid, other terminals never saw table go back to available
2. **Close-tab route missing floor plan dispatch** — Same issue for bar tab close
3. **Items append route missing all socket dispatches** — Adding items to existing order triggered zero cross-terminal updates
4. **Long-press too sensitive (500ms)** — Touchscreen taps frequently exceeded 500ms, triggering accidental virtual combine mode
5. **Ghost seed tables** — 8 old `table-*` ID tables with null deletedAt appearing as phantom tables
6. **Auth redirect on page refresh** — Zustand default state triggered `/login` redirect before localStorage rehydration

### Next Session Priority
1. **T-044 (P0)**: Verify VOID/COMP stamps render on FloorPlanHome
2. **T-047 (P2)**: Wire dispatchOpenOrdersChanged into void/delete route
3. **T-038 (P2)**: Fix usePOSLayout Failed to fetch timing
4. **T-040 (P1)**: Verify per-item delay countdown + auto-fire

## Session: February 9, 2026 (Socket Layer + Fetch Consolidation)

### Skills Completed
| Skill | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 247 | Tab Incremental Auth & Re-Auth Flow | DONE |
| 248 | Socket Layer + Fetch Consolidation | DONE |

### Skill 247: Tab Incremental Auth & Re-Auth Flow
- IncrementalAuthByRecordNo via Datacap (card-not-present, stored RecordNo token)
- "Re-Auth ••••1234" button replaces "Start a Tab" when card on file
- Configurable tip buffer (default 25%) in `/settings` under "Bar Tab / Pre-Auth"
- Force vs Auto increment modes (force bypasses threshold, no minimum floor)
- Admin settings: `incrementTipBufferPercent`, `incrementThresholdPercent`, `incrementAmount`, `maxTabAlertAmount`
- Updates both `OrderCard.authAmount` AND `order.preAuthAmount` in transaction

### Skill 248: Socket Layer + Fetch Consolidation
Full plan implemented across 2 phases to eliminate ~40 req/min of polling and redundant fetches.

**Phase 1 — Quick Wins (No New Socket Infrastructure):**
- **1A: Removed 5 redundant post-mutation refetches** — `handleHoldToggle`, `handleNoteEdit`, `handleCourseChange`, `handleSeatChange`, `handleResend` now just call shared handlers (which already update Zustand store)
- **1B: Fixed startEntertainmentTimers** — reads from `useOrderStore.getState().currentOrder?.items` instead of fetching `GET /api/orders/{orderId}`
- **1C: Debounced loadOpenOrdersCount** — 300ms debounce collapses rapid `tabsRefreshTrigger` bursts (11 call sites) into single fetch
- **1D: Throttled loadMenu** — leading-edge throttle for post-mutation loadMenu calls; reduced entertainment polling from 3s to 10s

**Phase 2 — Socket Layer:**
- **2A: Added ORDER_TOTALS_UPDATE + OPEN_ORDERS_CHANGED** to broadcast route (was silently 400ing from 4 API routes)
- **2B: Added `dispatchOpenOrdersChanged`** function to socket-dispatch.ts
- **2C: Wired `dispatchOpenOrdersChanged`** into orders create + pay API routes (fire-and-forget)
- **2D: Wired `dispatchEntertainmentStatusChanged`** into entertainment block-time (POST/PATCH/DELETE), status (PATCH), and send route — function existed but was never called
- **2E: Created `useOrderSockets` hook** — lightweight client hook following useKDSSockets pattern, `callbacksRef` to avoid reconnects, named handlers with explicit `off()` cleanup
- **2F: Wired `useOrderSockets` into orders/page.tsx** — `onOpenOrdersChanged` triggers debounced count refresh, `onEntertainmentStatusChanged` patches specific menu item in local state (no full reload). Replaced 10s entertainment polling with socket + visibility-change fallback.
- **2G: Replaced OpenOrdersPanel 3s polling** — removed `setInterval(() => loadOrders(), 3000)` and `window.focus` listener, replaced with `useOrderSockets` subscription + visibility-change fallback

**Nits Fixed:**
- Removed `order:created` listener (double-refresh — `orders:list-changed` already covers creates; `order:created` is a KDS event at send time)
- Added explicit `socket.off()` calls on cleanup for all 7 listeners
- Reduced `reconnectionAttempts` from 10 to 3, increased delay (less aggressive in dev without socket server)
- Downgraded `connect_error` from `console.error` to `console.warn`

### Other Work This Session
- **A++++ Pricing Checklist** (5 items): syncServerTotals Zustand method, removed dead handlePaymentComplete/handlePaymentSuccess (62 lines), fixed PaymentModal orderTotal=0 prop, fixed quick-pick quantity closure drift, tax-inclusive documentation
- **Cash rounding fix** in PaymentModal (`applyPriceRounding` to cashTotal)
- **Deleted legacy "order-entry" view** (~1850 lines of dead code)
- **Dead code cleanup**: 18+ unused imports, 12+ dead state vars, 10+ dead handlers

### Impact
| Change | Savings |
|--------|---------|
| Entertainment polling removed | ~6 req/min → 0 |
| Open orders polling removed | ~20 req/min → 0 |
| 5 redundant refetches removed | 5 fewer GETs per user action |
| Debounced tabs refresh | 2-3 fewer GETs per burst |
| Dead code removed | ~1,850+ lines deleted |
| **Total steady-state** | **~40 req/min eliminated** |

### Files Created
- `src/hooks/useOrderSockets.ts` — Client socket hook (160 lines)

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx` | Removed 5 refetches, fixed entertainment timers, debounce, throttle, wired useOrderSockets, deleted dead code, pricing fixes |
| `src/components/orders/OpenOrdersPanel.tsx` | Replaced 3s polling with useOrderSockets |
| `src/stores/order-store.ts` | Added syncServerTotals method |
| `src/components/payment/PaymentModal.tsx` | Cash rounding fix, orderTotal prop fix |
| `src/app/api/internal/socket/broadcast/route.ts` | Added ORDER_TOTALS_UPDATE + OPEN_ORDERS_CHANGED cases |
| `src/lib/socket-dispatch.ts` | Added dispatchOpenOrdersChanged function |
| `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` | Fire dispatchOpenOrdersChanged on create |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/pay/route.ts` | Fire dispatchOpenOrdersChanged on pay |
| `src/app/api/entertainment/block-time/route.ts` | Fire dispatchEntertainmentStatusChanged on POST/PATCH/DELETE |
| `src/app/api/entertainment/status/route.ts` | Fire dispatchEntertainmentStatusChanged on PATCH |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/send/route.ts` | Fire dispatchEntertainmentStatusChanged for entertainment items |
| `src/app/api/orders/[id]/auto-increment/route.ts` | Tab incremental auth with tip buffer, force mode |
| `src/components/orders/OrderPanelActions.tsx` | Re-Auth button label |
| `src/hooks/useOrderSettings.ts` | incrementTipBufferPercent default |

### Bugs Found / Fixed
1. **ORDER_TOTALS_UPDATE silent 400** — `dispatchOrderTotalsUpdate` was called from 4 API routes but broadcast route had no matching case. All dispatches silently failed.
2. **dispatchEntertainmentStatusChanged never called** — Function existed in socket-dispatch.ts but zero API routes fired it.
3. **handleResend double refetch** — sharedResend already calls loadOrder(), then orders/page.tsx refetched again.
4. **Dead payment handlers** — handlePaymentComplete (26 lines) and handlePaymentSuccess (36 lines) were never called after legacy view deletion.
5. **order:created double-refresh** — Socket hook listened for both `orders:list-changed` and `order:created`, causing double refresh on send-to-kitchen.
6. **Socket timeout in dev** — reconnectionAttempts=10 with 1s delay spammed console. Reduced to 3 attempts with 2s delay.

### Next Session Priority
1. **T-044 (P0)**: Verify VOID/COMP stamps render on FloorPlanHome
2. **T-038 (P2)**: Fix usePOSLayout Failed to fetch timing
3. **T-040 (P1)**: Verify per-item delay countdown + auto-fire
4. Closed Orders Management (Skill 114)
5. Bar Tabs UI improvements (Skill 20)

## Session: February 7, 2026 (Late Night — BartenderView Unification & Void/Comp)

### Skills Completed
| Skill | Name | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 235 | Unified BartenderView Tab Panel | DONE |
| 236 | Comp/Void from BartenderView | DONE |
| 237 | Waste Tracking "Was It Made?" | DONE |
| 238 | VOID/COMP Stamps on Order Panel | PARTIAL |

### Skill 235: Unified BartenderView Tab Panel
- Deleted ~450 lines of custom tab list from BartenderView (loadTabs, Tab/TabItem types, polling, filteredTabs, tabs state)
- Replaced with shared `<OpenOrdersPanel>` component
- Added `forceDark` prop to OpenOrdersPanel for BartenderView dark theme
- Added `employeePermissions` prop pass-through from orders/page.tsx
- Replaced selectedTab-based item loading with direct API fetch on selectedTabId change

### Skill 236: Comp/Void from BartenderView
- Added `onOpenCompVoid` callback prop to BartenderView
- Wired in orders/page.tsx to open CompVoidModal
- Previously showed "coming soon" toast — now fully functional

### Skill 237: Waste Tracking "Was It Made?"
- Added wasMade state to CompVoidModal with Yes/No buttons after reason selection
- Added `wasMade Boolean?` to OrderItem schema
- Added `wasMade Boolean @default(false)` to VoidLog schema
- API uses explicit `wasMade` from UI, falls back to reason-based detection
- Comp always sets wasMade=true (food was served)

### Skill 238: VOID/COMP Stamps on Order Panel (PARTIAL)
- Added `status`, `voidReason`, `wasMade` to OrderItem in order-store.ts
- Added same fields to LoadedOrderData, OrderPanelItemData interfaces
- Added to useOrderPanelItems hook mapping
- Added to order-response-mapper.ts
- OrderPanelItem renders: VOID/COMP badges, strikethrough, $0.00 price, waste indicator
- **Bug found**: FloorPlanHome's `setInlineOrderItems` shim was dropping status/voidReason/wasMade
- **Fix applied** to InlineOrderItem interface, prevAsInline, addItem, updateItem, and both API fetch mappings
- **NOT YET VERIFIED** — needs testing next session (T-044)

### Bugs Found
1. FloorPlanHome `setInlineOrderItems` shim silently drops fields not explicitly mapped
2. `calculateTotals` in order-store.ts sums ALL items including voided/comped — needs fix
3. PrismaClientValidationError after adding wasMade to schema — required dev server restart

### Files Modified
- `src/components/bartender/BartenderView.tsx` — Major deletion + OpenOrdersPanel integration + onOpenCompVoid
- `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx` — employeePermissions, comp/void handlers, order reload after void
- `src/components/orders/CompVoidModal.tsx` — wasMade UI
- `src/components/orders/OrderPanelItem.tsx` — VOID/COMP visual stamps
- `src/components/orders/OpenOrdersPanel.tsx` — forceDark prop
- `src/stores/order-store.ts` — status/voidReason/wasMade on interfaces
- `src/hooks/useOrderPanelItems.ts` — Pass through status fields
- `src/lib/api/order-response-mapper.ts` — voidReason/wasMade in response
- `src/app/api/orders/[id]/comp-void/route.ts` — wasMade field, improved error logging
- `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanHome.tsx` — Fixed shim to pass status fields
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — wasMade on VoidLog and OrderItem

### Next Session Priority
1. **T-044 (P0)**: Verify VOID/COMP stamps render on FloorPlanHome after shim fix
2. Fix `calculateTotals` to skip voided/comped items
3. Add test checklist items for void/comp visual verification

---

## Session: February 5, 2026 (Architecture Planning)

### Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Bar Mode** | Own route (`/bar`) | Can evolve independently, speed-optimized |
| **Top Bar** | Nav + Quick Actions | New Tab, Time Clock, Open Drawer always accessible |
| **Orders Panel** | Current order focus | Slower-paced, configurable default screen per employee/station |

### New Route Structure

```
/orders     → Floor Plan + Order Entry (slower-paced, table service)
/bar        → Speed Bar Mode (fast tab management, bartenders)
/tabs       → Tab Management (future - dedicated tab admin)
```

### Employee Default Screen

Each employee/station can have a default screen:
- Drive Thru → `/orders` with "Drive Thru" order type
- Dine In → `/orders` with floor plan
- Bar → `/bar`
- Phone Orders → `/orders` with "Phone Order" type

- **Ingredient Badges**: 🥃 spirit, 🍴 food
- **86'd Items**: Red styling with "86" badge, disabled
- **Tab Virtualization**: react-virtuoso for 500+ tabs performance
- **Employee Glow**: Emerald border/shadow on owned tabs

### Worker O1: Create Persistent TopBar Component

```
You are a DEVELOPER creating a persistent top navigation bar for GWI POS.

## Context
The top bar needs to be visible on both /orders and /bar screens, providing quick navigation and actions.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️  STRICT BOUNDARY - CREATE THESE FILES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Files to Create:**
1. `src/components/pos/TopBar.tsx`

## Requirements

### Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [☰] [🍽️ Orders] [🍺 Bar] │ [+ Tab] [⏱️ Clock] [💵 Drawer] │ 3:45 PM  John S. [▼] │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Left Section (Navigation)
- Hamburger menu (☰) → Opens AdminNav sidebar
- Orders button → Link to /orders (highlight when active)
- Bar button → Link to /bar (highlight when active)

### Center Section (Quick Actions)
- [+ Tab] → Opens NewTabModal
- [⏱️ Clock] → Opens TimeClockModal
- [💵 Drawer] → Opens cash drawer (future: drawer management)

### Right Section (Status)
- Current time (updates every minute)
- Employee name
- Dropdown menu: Clock Out, Switch User, Settings

### Props Interface
```typescript
interface TopBarProps {
  employee: {
    id: string
    name: string
    role?: { name: string }
  }
  currentRoute: 'orders' | 'bar' | 'tabs'
  onOpenAdminNav: () => void
  onOpenNewTab: () => void
  onOpenTimeClock: () => void
  onOpenDrawer: () => void
  onLogout: () => void
}
```

### Styling
- Height: 56px (fixed)
- Background: Dark glass effect (bg-gray-900/95 backdrop-blur)
- Text: White/gray
- Buttons: Subtle hover states
- Active route: Blue highlight

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Component renders with all sections
- [ ] Navigation links work (use Next.js Link)
- [ ] Active route is highlighted
- [ ] Clock updates every minute
- [ ] All callbacks fire correctly
- [ ] Responsive (collapses gracefully on small screens)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
```

### Worker O2: Create /bar Route with BarModePage

```
You are a DEVELOPER creating a dedicated Bar Mode page for GWI POS.

## Context
Bar Mode needs its own route (/bar) optimized for speed - bartenders need to open tabs, add items, and close out quickly.

```

### Key Features
1. **Tabs List Always Visible** - Right side, scrollable
2. **Quick Tab Creation** - One tap to start new tab
3. **Large Touch Targets** - Minimum 64px height for items
4. **Horizontal Categories** - Quick category switching
5. **Item Grid** - 3-4 columns, easy scanning

### Tab Card Actions
- **View** → Expands to show items, allows adding more
- **Pay** → Opens PaymentModal
- **Close** → Quick close (requires payment first)

### State Management
- Use existing order store for orders
- Load open tabs on mount
- Real-time updates via socket (future)

### Initial Implementation
For now, import and use existing components:
- Use BartenderView logic as starting point
- Import PaymentModal, NewTabModal
- Import TopBar (from O1)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Route accessible at /bar
- [ ] Auth redirect if not logged in
- [ ] Categories load from API
- [ ] Items display in grid
- [ ] Tabs list shows open bar tabs
- [ ] Can create new tab
- [ ] Can add items to selected tab
- [ ] Can open payment modal
- [ ] TopBar visible and functional
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
```

### Worker O3: Create Shared OrderPanel Component

```
You are a DEVELOPER extracting the order panel into a shared component for GWI POS.

## Context
The order panel (right side showing current order, items, totals) needs to be a reusable component used by both /orders and /bar pages. This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH for all orders.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️  STRICT BOUNDARY - CREATE THESE FILES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Files to Create:**
1. `src/components/orders/OrderPanel.tsx`
2. `src/components/orders/OrderPanelItem.tsx`
3. `src/components/orders/OrderPanelActions.tsx`

## Requirements

### Worker O4: Add Employee Default Screen Setting

```
You are a DEVELOPER adding default screen settings for employees in GWI POS.

## Context
Each employee or station needs a configurable default screen that loads after login.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
⚠️  STRICT BOUNDARY - MODIFY THESE FILES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Files to Modify:**
1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Add field to Employee model
2. `src/app/api/employees/[id]/route.ts` - Include in GET/PUT
3. `src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Redirect based on setting

## Schema Change

Add to Employee model:
```prisma
model Employee {
  // ... existing fields

  // Default screen after login
  // 'orders' | 'bar' | 'floor-plan' | 'kds'
  defaultScreen     String?   @default("orders")

  // Default order type to pre-select (slug)
  defaultOrderType  String?
}
```

## API Changes

### GET /api/employees/[id]
Include `defaultScreen` and `defaultOrderType` in response.

### PUT /api/employees/[id]
Allow updating `defaultScreen` and `defaultOrderType`.

## Login Redirect Logic

After successful login in `/login/page.tsx`:

```typescript
// Get default screen from employee data
const defaultScreen = employee.defaultScreen || 'orders'

// Redirect based on setting
switch (defaultScreen) {
  case 'bar':
    router.push('/bar')
    break
  case 'kds':
    router.push('/kds')
    break
  case 'floor-plan':
  case 'orders':
  default:
    router.push('/orders')
    break
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Schema has new fields
- [ ] Migration runs cleanly
- [ ] API returns/updates new fields
- [ ] Login redirects based on defaultScreen
- [ ] Falls back to /orders if not set
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
```

## Session: February 6, 2026 (Workers O31.5-O35 - OrderPanel Unification)

### Context

The OrderPanel component was being rendered differently across three screens: `/orders`, `/bar`, and `FloorPlanHome`. Each had divergent implementations — different props wired, different styling, different item controls. Goal: **"One OrderPanel to rule them all"** — unified component used identically everywhere.

### Completed Workers

| Worker | Task | Status | Files |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| O31.5 | Restore OrderPanel.tsx (lost to agent revert) | ✅ Complete | `src/components/orders/OrderPanel.tsx` |
| O32 | Wire 13 missing props on /orders page | ✅ Complete | `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx` |
| O33 | Remove external header from /bar | ✅ Complete | `src/app/(pos)/bar/page.tsx` |
| O34 | Replace inline rendering in FloorPlanHome | ✅ Complete | `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanHome.tsx` |
| O35 | Fix TS error in items/route.ts (id → orderId) | ✅ Complete | `src/app/api/orders/[id]/items/route.ts` |

### What Changed

**OrderPanel.tsx (O31.5 - Restored to 481 lines)**
- `SeatGroup` interface for table service display
- `renderHeader` / `hideHeader` props for consumer customization
- `cashDiscountRate` / `taxRate` / `onPaymentModeChange` pass-through to OrderPanelActions
- `seatGroups` prop for grouped item rendering
- `useMemo` for `pendingItems` / `sentItems` extraction
- `renderItem` / `renderPendingItems()` / `renderSentItems()` helpers
- `hasPendingItems` checks `sentToKitchen` flag
- `orderNumber` type widened to `number | string | null`
- `discounts` made optional with default 0

**/orders page (O32 - +217 lines)**
- Added `expandedItemId` state
- Created 10 handler functions: `handleHoldToggle`, `handleNoteEdit`, `handleCourseChange`, `handleEditModifiers`, `handleCompVoid`, `handleResend`, `handleSplit`, `handleToggleExpand`, `handleSeatChange`, `handlePaymentSuccess`
- Wired all 13 missing props to `<OrderPanel>` including Datacap props

**/bar page (O33 - -28 lines)**
- Deleted external light-theme header (was rendered outside OrderPanel)
- Stripped wrapper div gradient styling
- OrderPanel now renders its own dark default header

**FloorPlanHome (O34 - net -200 lines)**
- Removed imports: `OrderPanelItem`, `OrderPanelActions`
- Added imports: `OrderPanel`, `OrderPanelItemData`
- Created `seatGroupsForPanel` useMemo
- Replaced ~300 lines of inline rendering with single `<OrderPanel>` call
- Uses `hideHeader={true}` (FloorPlanHome has its own header)
- Added TODO comments on potentially redundant state

**items/route.ts (O35 - 1 line fix)**
- Fixed line 310: `${id}` → `${orderId}` (undeclared variable reference)

### Issues Encountered

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| PM accidentally launched Task agents instead of providing prompts | Stopped agents, user clarified: "going forward send me the worker prompts" |
| Stopped agents reverted OrderPanel.tsx to older commit, losing uncommitted changes | Added O31.5 worker to restore all features |
| O32 had 4 TS errors in handleCompVoid | Fixed: `m.modifier?.name` → `m.name`, removed non-existent `status`/`voidReason` fields |
| Pre-existing TS error in items/route.ts (`id` vs `orderId`) | Fixed by O35 worker |
| 4 Payments domain TS errors (Datacap interface mismatches) | Acknowledged as in-progress Payments work — not our domain |

### TypeScript Status

**Orders domain: 0 errors** (confirmed after O35)

### Key Architectural Decision

All three screens now use `<OrderPanel>` identically. The component provides:
- Same item controls everywhere (Qty +/-, Note, Hold, Course, Edit, Delete, More)
- Same footer and payment buttons
- Same display rules for items/modifiers
- Only the header can differ (via `renderHeader` or `hideHeader` props)

No more duplicate layouts to get out of sync.

## Session: February 7, 2026 (OrderPanel Enhancements)

### Overview

Major enhancement session adding 6 new files and modifying 9 existing files. Three feature phases completed plus critical modifier depth pipeline fix.

### Phase 1: Note Edit Modal (COMPLETE)

**Problem:** `window.prompt()` for kitchen notes — terrible UX on iPad/touch.

**Solution:** New `NoteEditModal.tsx` component — dark glassmorphism modal with textarea, auto-focus, keyboard shortcuts (Enter=save, Esc=cancel).

**Files:**
- NEW: `src/components/orders/NoteEditModal.tsx` (~80 lines)
- Modified: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts` — exposes `noteEditTarget`, `openNoteEditor()`, `closeNoteEditor()`, `saveNote()`
- Modified: `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanHome.tsx` — wired NoteEditModal
- Modified: `src/components/bartender/BartenderView.tsx` — wired NoteEditModal

### Phase 2: Quick Pick Numbers (COMPLETE)

**Concept:** Vertical gutter strip between menu grid and order panel for fast bartender/server workflow.

**Features:**
- Number buttons (1-9) for instant quantity setting
- Multi-digit entry (tap 1→0 = 10 within 800ms buffer)
- Multi-select mode for batch operations
- HLD (hold) button
- Delay presets (5m, 10m, 15m, 20m) with course buttons (C1-C5)
- Per-employee toggle in settings (`quickPickEnabled`)
- Auto-select newest pending item

**Files:**
- NEW: `src/hooks/useQuickPick.ts` (~60 lines)
- NEW: `src/components/orders/QuickPickStrip.tsx` (~290 lines)
- Modified: `src/lib/settings.ts` — added `quickPickEnabled`, `coursingCourseCount`, `coursingDefaultDelay`
- Modified: `src/components/orders/OrderPanel.tsx` — selection props, multi-select support
- Modified: `src/components/orders/OrderPanelItem.tsx` — selection highlight (purple border)

### Phase 3: Coursing & Per-Item Delays (COMPLETE)

**Sub-phases:**

**3A: Table Options Popover**
- NEW: `src/components/orders/TableOptionsPopover.tsx` — tap table name to toggle coursing, set guest count

**3B: Coursing Store/Hook**
- Modified: `src/stores/order-store.ts` — `setCoursingEnabled`, `setCourseDelay`, `fireCourse`, per-item delay actions
- Modified: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts` — coursing + delay state exposure

**3C: Course Grouping + Delay Controls**
- NEW: `src/components/orders/CourseDelayControls.tsx` — between-course delay controls with countdown timers
- NEW: `src/components/orders/OrderDelayBanner.tsx` — order-level delay status banner

**3D: Send Logic with Per-Item Delays**
- NEW: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/fire-course/route.ts` — fire specific courses
- Modified: `src/app/api/orders/[id]/send/route.ts` — supports `itemIds` parameter for selective item sending
- Modified: `src/hooks/useActiveOrder.ts` — `handleSendToKitchen` splits immediate vs delayed items
- Hold and Delay are mutually exclusive — setting one clears the other

### OrderPanelItem Layout Streamlining (COMPLETE)

**Changes:**
- Removed redundant controls: qty ±, course row, expanded section (QuickPickStrip handles these)
- Removed Hold button from item (only on gutter)
- Note button moved inline with item name row (icon-only, 16x16)
- Delete button moved under price amount (vertical column layout)
- Edit button removed (tap item to edit mods)

### Modifier Depth Indentation (COMPLETE — CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** Child modifiers (e.g., Ranch under House Salad) displayed flat with no hierarchy indication.

**Root Cause:** Modifier `depth` and `preModifier` were being stripped at **7 different points** in the data pipeline — most critically at `FloorPlanHome.tsx` line 4831 where items are passed to `<OrderPanel>`.

**Fix:** All 7 stripping points fixed across 4 files:
1. `FloorPlanHome.tsx` — `<OrderPanel items={}>` prop (THE main bug), comp/void modal, split check modal
2. `BartenderView.tsx` — prevAsOrderItems mapping, store.addItem/updateItem (was hardcoding `depth: 0`)
3. `orders/page.tsx` — comp/void modal, split check modal, type annotation

**Visual Result:**
- Depth 0: `•` prefix, 8px indent, `#94a3b8`, 12px font
- Depth 1: `–` prefix, 18px indent, `#7d8da0`, 11px font
- Depth 2+: `∘` prefix, 28px indent, `#64748b`, 11px font
- Pre-modifiers: NO (red `#f87171`), EXTRA (amber `#fbbf24`), LITE (blue `#60a5fa`)

### Open Orders Panel Enhancements

- Modified: `src/components/orders/OpenOrdersPanel.tsx` — added status badges for Delayed, Held, Coursing orders
- Modified: `src/app/api/orders/open/route.ts` — returns `hasHeldItems`, `hasDelayedItems`, `hasCoursingEnabled`, `courseMode`

### All Files Changed

| File | Type | Phase |

## Session: February 7, 2026 (Late) — OrderPanel Pipeline Consolidation & Depth Fix

### Overview

Cross-domain session (primarily run under PM: Menu) that fixed critical OrderPanel issues. The Orders domain received:
1. Shared `useOrderPanelItems` hook eliminating 3 duplicate item mapping pipelines
2. Modifier depth indentation fix (parent-chain walk replacing broken selections-based depth)
3. Updated modifier rendering in OrderPanelItem (Tailwind classes, `↳` arrows)
4. Pre-modifier boolean fields added to child modifier API response

### Changes to Orders Domain Files

#### NEW: `src/hooks/useOrderPanelItems.ts` (Skill 234)
Single source of truth for mapping Zustand order store items → `OrderPanelItemData[]`.

**Previously:** FloorPlanHome, BartenderView, and orders/page each had their own `.map()` pipeline to convert store items to `OrderPanelItemData`. These pipelines would diverge — some had `depth`, some didn't, some had `preModifier`, some didn't.

**Now:** All 3 views call `useOrderPanelItems(menuItems?)` and get identical data including:
- `depth: m.depth ?? 0`
- `preModifier: m.preModifier ?? null`
- `spiritTier: m.spiritTier ?? null`
- `linkedBottleProductId: m.linkedBottleProductId ?? null`
- `parentModifierId: m.parentModifierId ?? null`

#### Modified: `src/components/orders/OrderPanelItem.tsx`
- Updated `OrderPanelItemData` interface with all modifier fields
- Replaced modifier rendering block (lines 480-515):
  - Old: `•`/`–`/`∘` bullets, 10px indent, hardcoded hex colors
  - New: `•` top-level, `↳` children, 20px indent per depth, Tailwind classes
  - Pre-modifier labels: `NO` (red-400), `EXTRA` (amber-400), `LITE`/`SIDE` (blue-400)

#### Modified: `src/components/floor-plan/FloorPlanHome.tsx`
- Now imports and uses `useOrderPanelItems()` hook instead of inline `.map()`

#### Modified: `src/components/bartender/BartenderView.tsx`
- Now imports and uses `useOrderPanelItems()` hook instead of inline `.map()`

#### Modified: `src/app/(pos)/orders/page.tsx`
- Now imports and uses `useOrderPanelItems()` hook instead of inline `.map()`

#### Modified: `src/types/orders.ts`
- Added shared `IngredientModification` type (was only in order-store.ts)

### Cross-Domain Changes (Owned by PM: Menu, Affecting Orders)

#### `src/components/modifiers/useModifierSelections.ts`
- **Depth computation rewrite:** Replaced broken `getGroupDepth()` (walked selections, always returned 0) with `childToParentGroupId` useMemo + parent-chain walk
- **Stacking pricing fix:** Stacked modifier instances now use `extraPrice` when available
- Added `useMemo` import

#### `src/components/modifiers/ModifierGroupSection.tsx`
- Pre-modifier fallback: uses boolean fields (`allowNo`, `allowLite`, `allowExtra`, `allowOnSide`) when `allowedPreModifiers` JSON array is empty

#### `src/app/api/menu/modifiers/[id]/route.ts`
- Added `allowNo`, `allowLite`, `allowExtra`, `allowOnSide` to child modifier group API response

### Git Commit
- `a1ec1c7` — **Order Panel Update** (pushed to `fix-001-modifier-normalization`)

### Tests Verified
- Test 2.4: Child modifier groups depth display ✅
- Test 12.23: Modifier depth indentation with ↳ prefix ✅
- Test 12.24: Pre-modifier color labels (NO/EXTRA/LITE) ✅

### Known Issues
1. **T-038: `usePOSLayout.loadLayout` Failed to fetch** — Pre-existing timing issue, unchanged
2. **T-043: Duplicate `IngredientModification` interface** in `order-store.ts` shadows import from `@/types/orders`
3. **Multi-select pre-modifiers** not supported (T-042, assigned to PM: Menu)

### Task Board Updates
- **T-041 COMPLETED** — Modifier depth indentation verified on live POS
- **T-043 CREATED** → PM: Orders — Clean up duplicate interface in order-store.ts

## Session: February 7, 2026 (Late Night) — BartenderView Unification & Void/Comp Enhancements

### Overview

Four skills completed in this session: unified BartenderView tab panel, comp/void from BartenderView, waste tracking ("Was it made?"), and VOID/COMP visual stamps on the OrderPanel.

### Skill 235: Unified BartenderView Tab Panel (COMPLETE)

**Problem:** BartenderView had its own custom tab list implementation (~450 lines) that was divergent from the shared OpenOrdersPanel used on /orders.

**Solution:** Replaced custom tab list with shared `OpenOrdersPanel` component.

**Deleted from BartenderView:**
- `loadTabs` function
- `Tab` / `TabItem` types
- `TabSortOption` / `TabViewMode` types
- `tabs` state, `searchInputRef`, `selectedTab` useMemo
- 3-second polling interval

**Added:**
- `forceDark` prop on OpenOrdersPanel for dark theme in BartenderView
- `employeePermissions` prop pass-through from orders/page.tsx to BartenderView

### Skill 236: Comp/Void from BartenderView (COMPLETE)

**Problem:** BartenderView showed "coming soon" toast when attempting comp/void.

**Solution:** Added `onOpenCompVoid` callback prop to BartenderView, wired in orders/page.tsx to open CompVoidModal.

### Skill 237: Waste Tracking — "Was It Made?" (COMPLETE)

**Problem:** Void/comp flow guessed whether food was made based on reason text. Inaccurate for inventory tracking.

**Solution:**
- Added `wasMade` two-button UI (Yes/No) to CompVoidModal
- Added `wasMade` column to `VoidLog` schema
- Added `wasMade` column to `OrderItem` schema
- API uses explicit `wasMade` from UI instead of heuristic
- CompVoidModal requires "Was it made?" answer before void submission

### Skill 238: VOID/COMP Stamps on Order Panel (PARTIAL — needs verification)

**Changes:**
- Added `status`, `voidReason`, `wasMade` to OrderItem in order store (`order-store.ts`)
- Added same fields to `LoadedOrderData` interface
- Added same fields to `OrderPanelItemData`
- Added to `useOrderPanelItems` mapping
- Added to `order-response-mapper.ts`
- OrderPanelItem visual changes: VOID/COMP badges, strikethrough name, $0.00 price, waste indicator
- `handleCompVoidComplete` reloads order from API after comp/void

**Bug Found & Fixed:**
- FloorPlanHome's `setInlineOrderItems` shim was dropping `status`/`voidReason`/`wasMade` fields
- Added these fields to `InlineOrderItem` interface, `prevAsInline` mapping, `addItem` call, `updateItem` call, and both API fetch mappings in FloorPlanHome
- **Status:** Fix applied but not yet verified working — needs testing next session
