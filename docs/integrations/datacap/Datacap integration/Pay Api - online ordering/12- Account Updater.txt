Account Updater
Datacap’s Account Updater service is operated by two endpoints (create endpoint and delete endpoint). To use the service, an integrator will provide a Datacap token or encrypted card data to be enrolled in the account updater service. If the integrator successfully submits a token for account updater the create endpoint will return a Payment Account ID (PID) in the Token field. This PID can be used like any other multi-use Token. The PID is special in the fact that twice a month the card data will be checked and updated to newer card data if applicable. The integrator can be confident that while using a PID the card data is never more than 2 weeks out of date and is advised to try a recurring transaction a week later if a decline is received. If the integrator no longer wants to have a PID enrolled in the account updater service the delete endpoint is where the PID will be removed from getting updated and deleted. For a full listing of currently vaulted PIDs, see Reporting API

Note Interac cards are not supported on Datacap’s Card Account Updater service
