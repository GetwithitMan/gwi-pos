Implementation Notes:
1. To utilize Linked Returns, enable the Linked Returns setting in PSCS. To link a return to the sale or capture, save the RefNo value from the initial response and include the RefNo in the URL. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> tag is returned in the subsequent response with the remaining amount to be returned from the original sale or capture. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> value is the <Authorize> amount returned in the original sale or capture. A Linked Return of the full amount will result in 0.00 being returned.
