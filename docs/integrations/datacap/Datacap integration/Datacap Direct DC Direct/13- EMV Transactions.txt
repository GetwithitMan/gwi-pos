EMV TransactionsEMVPadResetTo reset and ready the DC Direct device for a new transaction.Implementation Notes:1. A CmdStatus response of “Success” is required to the EMVPadReset request in order to use the PIN pad.2. This command should be performed at the end of any card related transaction (Sale, VoidSale, Return, VoidReturn, VoiceAuth and ZeroAuth) to assure that the user is prompted to remove their card. If no EMV chip card is inserted in the reader, then an EMVPadReset will return a successful response in one second. If there’s an EMV chip card in the reader, then the EMVPadReset command will wait up to 15 seconds for removal. If the card is removed within that timeframe, then a successful response is returned when the card is removed. If the chip card remains in the reader after 15 seconds, an error response is returned “TRANSACTION NOT COMPLETE - Card Not Removed”.Sample Request? Required?

See Errors on error codes for possible values.CmdStatus(String 1-10 chars)RequiredIndicates the outcome of the command:“Success” = command completed successfully“Approved” = transaction approved by payment processor“Declined” = transaction declined by payment processor“Declined Offline” = chip transaction transaction declined offline“Error” = error processing command. Check DSIXReturnCode and TextResponse for additional info on error.TextResponse(String 1-255 chars)RequiredFor Successful responses, this field can contain an optional message from the server or processor. For other response codes, see Errors on Error Codes for values.SequenceNo(Number 1-20 chars)RequiredThe sequence number returned in all responses to be used on the next request. If the SequenceNo is lost or initial deployment of the PIN pad, the ECR/POS should attempt any transaction (using “0010010010” as a SequenceNo value) to re-sync.UserTrace(String 0-40 chars)Echo of data supplied by the user system in the request; for use by the user system for internal tracking. May be null if no user system data was supplied in the requestEMVSaleTo process a payment using EMV capable equipment. Credit and Debit transactions with chip, MSR and manually input account information are supported.Functional Option Tags for EMVSale:1. Cash Back - (Tag: <CashBack>) – Allows a cardholder to request cash back in addition to payment for the transaction. Debit and certain credit card allow cash back.2. Gratuity Entry - (Tag: <Gratuity>) – Allows a cardholder to specify a tip for a transaction in addition to a base transaction amount. Usually used by restaurant and service merchants. Provide a value of “SuggestivePrompt” along with the <GratuitySuggestions> tag to display a form containing buttons populated with custom gratuity amounts.3. Token Request - (Tags: <RecordNo> and <Frequency>) – Used to request an optional unique transaction identifier (token) to be assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to a subsequent AdjustByRecordNo transaction request to alter the amounts on the original transaction without possession of the card (e.g. for tip entry). Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the EMVSale will be able to request a token.4. For Fleet fields, in each <LineItem> contained inside the <PetroleumItems> tag, name numbers 1-9 are supported for a total of 9 <LineItem> items. eg, <LineItem1>, <ItemCode1> ... </LineItem1> <LineItem2> <ItemCode2> ... </LineItem2>. Note: Fleet is only supported on Fiserv Rapid Connect today.Implementation Notes:1. To request a token, set <RecordNo> to RecordNumberRequested2. The <Duplicate> tag is not supported by all EMV processing providers. In the event that a duplicate response is received for a request, using a value of “Override” for the <Duplicate> tag on a subsequent attempt will force the processing host to skip duplicate checking and therefore approve what appears to be a duplicate transaction. This is useful in cases where multiple transactions of the same amount to the same card within a short time period are necessary.3. Manual card account entry with the <AcctNo> tag should only be used if the PIN pad insertion reader fails to get card account information on the first transaction attempt. The POS logic should allow the transaction to be run again with the AcctNo tag included to force a manual entry of card account information.4. PartialAuth acceptance is required for select processors. In the case of a partial approval, the response <Authorize> amount will be less than the requested <Purchase> amount. The POS will need to perform a second transaction to collect the balance. Alternatively, the POS can issue a void, sending in the previously authorized amount in the <Purchase> field.5. To use Datacap’s “Surcharge with Lookup” feature, partners must utilize Datacap’s NETePay Hosted platform and incorporate the <SurchargeWithLookup> tag in the sale request of the transaction. Merchants who plan to use SurchargeWithLookup, must adhere to local and federal regulations.6. Level 3 card data is not supported on DC Direct Ingenico TETRA devices.Sample Request? Required?

On the receipt, you can provide your own description for the Payment Fee by using the <PaymentFeeDescription> tag. If <PaymentFeeDescription> is not provided, then “PAYMENT FEE” will be used on the receipt as the description. The PaymentFee amount is included in the purchase amount.Amount:Gratuity(Number 1-8 chars)Gratuity amount (with decimal places – eg. 29.95)OR“Prompt” (which will cause the PIN pad to prompt the cardholder to input the gratuity amount)OR“PrintBlankLine” (which will cause DC Direct to return <PrintData> that includes blank tip and total lines)OR“SuggestivePrompt” (which, when paired with GratuitySuggestsions, will display custom gratuity options on the PIN pad).The Gratuity amount is not included in the Purchase amount.Amount:GratuitySuggestions(String 1-100 chars)When the Gratuity value is “SuggestivePrompt”, this field defines the values displayed in the custom gratuity buttons. Four values must be provided, using format “Button1-Label [colon] Gratuity1-Amount [comma] Button2-Label [colon] Gratuity2-Amount [comma] Button3-Label [colon] Gratuity3-Amount [comma] Button4-Label [colon] Gratuity4-Amount” (ex: 10%:1.00,15%:1.50,18%:1.80,20%:2.00). If one of the four buttons are pressed, the corresponding gratuity amount is used for the transaction. The gratuity entry form also has a button for “Other” and “No”. Pressing “Other” will cause the pad to display a prompt to manually enter a gratuity amount. Pressing “No” will cause the pad to skip any gratuity entry.Amount:TotalOnTipPrompt(String 1-5 chars)Use the value “Allow” in conjunction with <Gratuity>SuggestivePrompt</Gratuity> and <GratuitySuggestions> to display the pre-gratuity total of transaction at the top of the gratuity options screen.Amount:CashBack(String 1-8 chars)Cash back amount with 2 decimal places (eg 29.95).

When <PrintData> elements exist, they should always be printed as the draft for the transaction.EMVSaleWithSplitTo process a payment using EMV capable equipment along with a separate, second transaction for a “split fee” amount. Credit and Debit transactions with chip, MSR and manually input account information are supported.Implementation Notes1. EMVSaleWithSplit requires NETePay Hosted.2. The <SplitMerchantID1> is the Hosted Merchant ID value that should be used to process the split fee payment.3. <SplitFee1> is the amount of the split fee payment.4. <CustomAmountFormat> is a field that contains a display message to be shown to the cardholder on a PAX PIN pad showing the amount of the EMVSale and the amount of the split fee. The value of the <CustomAmountFormat> tag maps to a text box contained in the latest PAX forms package. DC Direct checks the PAX forms package version to know if the variable exists before populating the variable for amount confirmation and when displaying the form to collect card data (Please Insert, Swipe or Tap Card). An example of the CustomAmountFormat sent on an EMVSaleWithSplit is <CustomAmountFormat>Payment Amount: $#PAYMENT##N#Fee Amount: $#FEE1#</CustomAmountFormat>.5. The print data returned by DC Direct is the EMV certified receipt with all required EMV fields pertaining to the primary transaction. It is up to the integrator to augment the receipt they print for the customer to include the split fee and display it as the integrator sees fit. Sample Request? Required?

Token Requirement - Before using the SaleByRecordNo transaction, a transaction must obtain an optional unique transaction identifier (token) that is assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to the subsequent SaleByRecordNo transaction in the <RecordNo> field and allows another payment from the card account used in the original transaction without the card being presented. Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the transaction will be able to request a token.2. To use Datacap’s “Surcharge with Lookup” feature, partners must utilize Datacap’s NETePay Hosted platform and incorporate the <SurchargeWithLookup> tag in the sale request of the transaction. Merchants who plan to use SurchargeWithLookup, must adhere to local and federal regulations.Sample Request? Required?

This value must be retained for use in a subsequent AdjustByRecordNo request.ISORespCode(Number 3 chars)3 digit response code from Canadian Host. <ISORespCode> is specific to Canadian processing only.PrintData:LineNNN(String 1-41 chars)Receipt print lines. Each <LineN> tag should be printed on a new line. Each <LineN> tag begins with a “.” which should not be printed – empty lines (blank) have only “.” as data. When <PrintData> elements exist, they should always be printed as the draft for the transaction.EMVPreAuthTo preauthorize a credit card which must be subsequently captured for settlement. Credit cards only are supported.Functional Option Tags for EMVPreAuth:1. Gratuity Entry - (Tag: <Gratuity>) – Allows a cardholder to specify a tip for a transaction in addition to a base transaction amount. Usually used by restaurant and service merchants.2. Token Request - (Tags: <RecordNo> and <Frequency>) – Used to request a unique transaction identifier (recurring token) to be assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to a subsequent PreAuthCaptureByRecordNo transaction request to alter the amounts on the original transaction without possession of the card (e.g. for tip entry). Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the EMVSale will be able to request a token.Implementation Notes:1. The <Duplicate> tag is not supported by all EMV processing providers. In the event that a duplicate response is received for a request, using a value of “Override” for the <Duplicate> tag on a subsequent attempt will force the processing host to skip duplicate checking and therefore approve what appears to be a duplicate transaction. This is useful in cases where multiple transactions of the same amount to the same card within a short time period are necessary.2. Manual card account entry with the <AcctNo> tag should only be used if the PIN pad insertion reader fails to get card account information on the first transaction attempt. The POS logic should allow the transaction to be run again with the <AcctNo> tag included to force a manual entry of card account information.3. Do not include an Authorize amount. The amount authorized will be the sum of the purchase amount and any gratuity amount that may be included.4. For a chip card, the EMV tag data is returned in the <ProcessData> field. It is required to send this data on the PreAuthCaptureByRecordNo.5. To use Datacap’s “Surcharge with Lookup” feature, partners must utilize Datacap’s NETePay Hosted platform and incorporate the <SurchargeWithLookup> tag in the sale request of the transaction. Merchants who plan to use SurchargeWithLookup, must adhere to local and federal regulations.Sample Request? Required?

Credit only.Notes:1. Gratuity Entry - (Tag: <Gratuity>) – Allows a cardholder to specify a tip for a transaction in addition to a base transaction amount. Usually used by restaurant and service merchants.2. Token Requirement - Before using the PreAuthByRecordNo transaction, a transaction must obtain an optional unique transaction identifier (token) that is assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to the subsequent PreAuthByRecordNo transaction in the <RecordNo> field and allows another payment from the card account used in the original transaction without the card being presented. Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the transaction will be able to request a token.Implementation Notes:1. <TranType> should be set to Credit2. To use Datacap’s “Surcharge with Lookup” feature, partners must utilize Datacap’s NETePay Hosted platform and incorporate the <SurchargeWithLookup> tag in the sale request of the transaction. Merchants who plan to use SurchargeWithLookup, must adhere to local and federal regulations.Sample Request? Required?

Each <LineN> tag begins with a “.” which should not be printed – empty lines (blank) have only “.” as data. When <PrintData> elements exist, they should always be printed as the draft for the transaction.EMVReturnTo process a return (refund) using EMV capable equipment. Credit and Debit transactions with chip, MSR and manually input account information are supported.Functional Options for EMVReturn:1. Token Request - (Tags: <RecordNo> and <Frequency>) – Used to request an optional unique transaction identifier (token) to be assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to a subsequent AdjustByRecordNo transaction request to alter the amounts on the original transaction without possession of the card (e.g. for tip entry). Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the EMVReturn will be able to request a token.Implementation Notes:1. The <Duplicate> tag is not supported by all EMV processing providers. In the event that a duplicate response is received for a request, using a value of “Override” for the <Duplicate> tag on a subsequent attempt will force the processing host to skip duplicate checking and therefore approve what appears to be a duplicate transaction. This is useful in cases where multiple transactions of the same amount to the same card within a short time period are necessary.2. To utilize Linked Returns, enable the Linked Returns setting in PSCS. To link a return to the sale or capture, save the PayAPI_Id value from the initial response and include it as the RefNo value in the request. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> tag is returned in the response with the remaining amount from the original sale or capture. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> value is the <Authorize> amount returned in the original sale or capture. A Linked Return of the full amount will result in 0.00 being returned.Sample Request?

Each <LineN> tag should be printed on a new line. Each <LineN> tag begins with a “.” which should not be printed – empty lines (blank) have only “.” as data. When <PrintData> elements exist, they should always be printed as the draft for the transaction.ApplicationLabel(String 1-40 chars)Transaction application labelAID(String 1-40 chars)Transaction AIDTVR(String 1-40 chars)Transaction TVRIAD(String 1-40 chars)Transaction IADTSI(String 1-40 chars)Transaction TSICVM(String 1-40 chars)Transaction CVMReturnByRecordNoProcess an EMVReturn transaction without a card present – credit.Notes:1. Token Requirement - Before using the ReturnByRecordNo transaction, a transaction must obtain an optional unique transaction identifier (token) that is assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to the subsequent ReturnByRecordNo transaction in the <RecordNo> field and allows another payment from the card account used in the original transaction without the card being presented. Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the transaction will be able to request a token.2. The <Duplicate> tag is not supported by all EMV processing providers. In the event that a duplicate response is received for a request, using a value of “Override” for the <Duplicate> tag on a subsequent attempt will force the processing host to skip duplicate checking and therefore approve what appears to be a duplicate transaction. This is useful in cases where multiple transactions of the same amount to the same card within a short time period are necessary.Implementation Notes:1. <TranType> should be set to Credit2. To utilize Linked Returns, enable the Linked Returns setting in PSCS. To link a return to the sale or capture, save the PayAPI_Id value from the initial response and include it as the RefNo value in the request. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> tag is returned in the response with the remaining amount from the original sale or capture. The <ReturnAmountRemaining> value is the <Authorize> amount returned in the original sale or capture. A Linked Return of the full amount will result in 0.00 being returned.Sample Request?

This transaction does not create a charge/debit to the cardholder account and no funds will be accrued to the merchant.Functional Options for EMVZeroAuth:1. Token Request - (Tags: <RecordNo> and <Frequency>) – Used to request an optional unique transaction identifier (token) to be assigned by the payment processor and returned in the transaction response. This token value is supplied to a subsequent AdjustByRecordNo transaction request to alter the amounts on the original transaction without possession of the card (e.g. for tip entry). Note that not all processors support token issuance or subsequent use and that only cards that don’t require a PIN entry during the EMVZeroAuth will be able to request a token. Implementation Notes:2. <Amount:Purchase> should be set to 0.00Sample Request? Required?

When <PrintData> elements exist, they should always be printed as the draft for the transaction.PreAuthCaptureByRecordNoTo add a gratuity to a previously processed EMVPreAuth transaction and capture the transaction to the current batch.Notes:1. Each time a PreAuthCaptureByRecordNo is performed it will add a transaction to the current batch. If a mistake is made with the gratuity amount, a VoidSaleByRecordNo must be used to Void the transaction. Then a SaleByRecordNo can be performed using the same purchase amount and the correct gratuity amount.2. For a chip card, the EMV tag data returned in the <ProcessData> tag on the original EMVPreAuth response must be sent in the <ProcessData> field.Implementation Notes:1. <TranType> should be set to Credit2. Use the <RefNo>, <AuthCode>, <RecordNo>, <InvoiceNo> ,<ProcessData> and <AcqRefData> values obtained in the response to a previous transaction.3. Receipt printing is not required for PreAuthCaptureByRecordNo transactions.Sample Request? Required?
