GetSignature is a separate request that could be sent at anytime to obtain a digitized signature from the customer.2. An EMVPadReset must be performed prior to GetSignature to ensure the customer’s card is removed from the DC Direct device.3. A GetSignature request allows the integrator to optionally obtain a digitized signature from the customer for paperless record keeping of receipts when using a device that support signature capture. When a response contains the <CVM> tag, the values can be one of the following:“SIGN”“PIN VERIFIED”“PIN VERIFIED AND SIGN”“NONE”If the response value for <CVM> contains either “SIGN” or “PIN VERIFIED AND SIGN”, then send the GetSignature request. The GetSignature response should be saved with an electronic copy of the receipt for that transaction to support a merchant in a charge back request. The GetSignature response data could be converted to a graphic format, such as .bmp) and included in the stored receipt image. In the absence of a CVM (when a non-EMV card is presented), a signature can still be collected except when CardType is DEBIT.4. The Signature response data is a string of up to 8192 characters and is returned as a series of “strokes” and within each stroke is a series of X,Y coordinate points. The first point of a stroke is always a “move to” position. All subsequent points within a stroke are “draw to” positions. The “end stroke point” is simply “#,#”. That would be followed by the first point of the next stroke. X and Y coordinates are separated by a comma and end with a colon.Sample Request? Required?
