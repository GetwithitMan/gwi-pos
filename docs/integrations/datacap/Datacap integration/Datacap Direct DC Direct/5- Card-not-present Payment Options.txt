Card-not-present Payment OptionsPay APIWhat is Pay APIPay API is Datacap’s card-not-present payment API built around RESTful standards. These include standard HTTP methods (POST/GET/PUT), content types (JSON/XML/form encoded), and a resource-oriented architecture. It’s a straightforward integration to ecommerce credit, debit, and gift.Pay API allows your merchants to enable omnichannel payments via cross-platform tokens using the same payment processor that they use for in-store payments (One batch. One set of reports. One merchant billing statement. One Payment Solution provider for in-store and above-store transactions.)Go to Pay API DocsBrandable Payment LinksWhat are Payment Links?Payment Links API is an additional Card-Not-Present option used to generate customizable links for payment sent through SMS or Email. Composed of similar HTTP methods to Pay API such as (POST/GET/PUT), and content types (JSON/XML/form encoded), Payment Links provides a streamlined way to prompt for Debit, Credit, ACH, Apple Pay and Google Pay payments through the web, without building a separate webpage. Using existing Pay API credentials for Authorization and Payment Routing, Payment Links API offers features such as Updating existing links, Cancelling active links, Querying sent links and more.Go to Payment Links API
