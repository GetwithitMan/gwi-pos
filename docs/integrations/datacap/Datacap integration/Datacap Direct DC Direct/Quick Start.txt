For EBT transactions, dsiPDCX allows clear card data to be collected from encrypted devices. This includes PAX, Ingenico Tetra and Verifone P400 devices. dsiPDCX keeps a list of all of the EBT card BINs and allows those cards to be clear when processing EBT (Foodstamp or Cash). This change updates the EBT BIN list to include the Sun Bucks program BINs (507691, 507712, 639795, 669042, 984000).2. The Prepaid card whitelist is updated to include BIN 605038, 19 digits in length. This change is for PDQ/Signature Systems Ð Jimmy JohnÕs. When swiping a card with this new BIN, the Verifone P400 may or may not need a whitelist change depending on how these prepaid / gift cards are encoded. A whitelist change will be required for manual entry.3. There were no changes required to dsiPDCX to support GalaxyPay Create and Set transactions. These transactions flow through dsiPDCX.4. Added fix for Verifone P400 clear read functionality for GetPrePaidStripe manual entry. Account number BIN must be in P400 whitelist.? Click here to download dsiPDCX 1.99(.exe)
