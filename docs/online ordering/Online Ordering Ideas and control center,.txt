Online Ordering Ideas and control center,

Overview 
payments I believe need to be made through data cap pay API that we need to develop and build that we do have a folder under the data cap section for the pay API, which is for the online payments

we should make a sub menu, which will take the current in-store menu and duplicate it. Refresh it and update it for the online menu. We can link the item to automatically update when the in-store menu updates or we can also add individual items for both in-store and online that do not merge back and forth.

timed menus would be nice to be able to turn items on and off. Payment requirements must be paid before sending and confirmation screen so customers know it has been paid and sent maybe even add a text message that it has been delivered to the restaurant and this is a confirmation text.

online orders should have a pop-up screen on the logout screen of all stations that orders are coming in or pending or pause online ordering just a quick ability to adjust things as long as they have to roll to do it under permissions employee permission permissions

online reporting can go into the daily sales, but it needs to be a separate line item online ordering sales totals should only be credit card, but make sure that the reporting is easy to identify which ones were online and which ones were off-line
