Blackhawk NetworkDatacap supports the Blackhawk Network Gift Service when utilizing Datacap’s NETePay Hosted omnichannel payments gateway. The Blackhawk Network integration is very similar to other GIFTePays because the trantype is “PrePaid”. Trancodes supported by Datacap’s Blackhawk Network integration include:? EMVIssueWithProductCode? NoNSFSale? EMVLinkedReturn? EMVReload? EMVVoidReload? EMVBalance? EMVBalanceWithProductCodeNote: NETePay Hosted is required to utilize Datacap’s Blackhawk Network integration.EMVIssueWithProductCodeTo activate a Gift Card for use with Blackhawk.IssueWithProductCode allows a wide range of Blackhawk gift cards to be sold by a merchant. For IssueWithProductCode or BalanceWithProductCode, the POS will scan the barcode on the Blackhawk Gift card packaging. The account number and product code must be supplied on the request to activate the gift card.If the status of activation is not immediately known, an approval is returned with a TextResponse of “CARD WILL BE ACTIVATED WITHIN 24 HOURS.” The GIFTePay service will then attempt to verify the activation status every 15 minutes until it receives an acknowledgement from BlackHawk, for up to 24 hours.No activation reversal is supported. VoidIssue is not supported.ExampleThe first 11 digits is the Product Code. The remaining 19 digits is the Account Number. Send the 11-digit product code in the <ProductCode> XML tag. Send the Account Number in the <AcctNo> XML tag. For an Issue/Activation, be sure to include the payment details with at least one Payment Type.For dsiPDCX, send a valid <ComPort> value and <SecureDevice> with a value of “NONE” when reading and parsing a barcode (IssueWithProductCode or BalanceWithProductCode).XML Request Template? xml?POST /ProcessEMVTransaction/ HTTP/1.1Host: 192.168.1.232:8080Content-Type: application/xmlContent-Length: 462<?xml version="1.0" ?><TStream>    <Transaction>        <OperationMode>PROD</OperationMode>        <MerchantID>MERCHID</MerchantID>        <UserTrace>TRACE:1428755984072159646203337026735209</UserTrace>        <POSPackageID>PyTest:2.0</POSPackageID>        <TranCode>EMVIssueWithProductCode</TranCode>        <SecureDevice>CloudEMV2</SecureDevice>        <RefNo>123456</RefNo>        <InvoiceNo>001</InvoiceNo>        <SequenceNo>0010010010</SequenceNo>        <OperatorID>001</OperatorID>        <Duplicate>None</Duplicate>        <Account>            <AcctNo>SecureDevice</AcctNo>        </Account>        <Amount>            <Purchase>25.00</Purchase>        </Amount>        <PartialAuth>Allow</PartialAuth>        <TranType>PrePaid</TranType>        <ProductCode>07675004390</ProductCode>        <PaymentType1>Credit</PaymentType1>        <PaymentMode1>Chip</PaymentMode1>        <PaymentType2>Credit</PaymentType2>        <PaymentMode2>Online</PaymentMode2>        <PaymentType3>Cash</PaymentType3>        <PaymentMode3>Manual</PaymentMode3>        <TranDeviceID>1640014855</TranDeviceID>    </Transaction></TStream>?OperationMode(String 1-4 chars)Used to direct dsiEMVAndroid traffic to a specific NETePay Hosted environment.
