CanadaOverviewDC Direct is supported to Global Canada using the PAX A920Pro or PAX IM30 devices. Canadian transaction processing was added to DC Direct in version 1.12 for PAX Android devices.Differences between US and Canadian Integration1. Support for Credit and Debit(Interac) is required.2. Store and Forward (offline processing) is not supported in Canada3. Cash Back is not allowed4. SurchargeWithLookup is not supported5. PaymentFee is not supported6. EMVSaleWithSplit is not supported7. SequenceNo value is returned by the processors in Canada. The SequenceNo value is tracked per terminal8. Prompting for tip at time of sale is supported9. Support for English and French languages10. Additional XML Response tags are returned for receipt printing specific to merchant and customer language.11. Receipt data is returned for merchant and customer copyTagDescription<ReceiptLanguage>(String 6-7 chars) Returns a value of French or English. This value is used by the POS to determine the language to be used to print the Merchant receipt header (“TRANSACTION RECORD” or “RELEVE DE TRANSACTION”)<CustomerReceiptLanguage>(String 6-7 chars) Returns a value of French or English. This value is used by the POS to determine the language to be used to print the Customer receipt header (“TRANSACTION RECORD” or “RELEVE DE TRANSACTION”)<ISORespCode>(Number 3 chars) 3 digit response code from Canadian Host.ReceiptsFor Canada, receipt data is returned for the merchant and customer copy. Two separate sets of receipt data are returned. The merchant receipt is returned in tags <Line1> to <LineN>. The customer receipt is returned in tags <CustLine1> to <CustLineN>. The merchant receipt is generated in the language of the merchant and corresponds with Merchant Language set as the PSCS parameter. The customer receipt is generated in the cardholder language. Before printing the receipt, the POS should still print the receipt header, merchant name, address, and phone number as separate lines at the top of the receipt. Receipt examples are available in EMVTransactions section.EMV Transactions and Operations Supported by DC Direct CanadaThe DC Direct integration for Canada supports the following transactions:Credit/Debit TransactionsDefinitionSupported byEMVPadResetThis command must be performed after every monetary transaction (Sale, VoidSale, Return, VoidReturn, VoiceAuth, ZeroAuth, etc) to assure that no card remains in the PIN pad chip reader. If no card is in the reader, then a response should be returned in 2-3 seconds. If there’s a card in the reader, the PIN pad displays ‘Remove Card’ and waits for the card to be removed before returning a response.Credit or DebitEMVSaleEMV Sale transaction.Credit or DebitEMVVoidSaleVoid a previously completed sale processed as Credit or Interac Debit. Voiding a sale processed as debit is only supported in CanadaCredit or DebitVoidSaleByRecordNoVoid of a previously completed EMV Sale transaction using transaction reference identifier(s).CreditSaleByRecordNoProcess an EMV Sale transaction without a card present.CreditEMVPreAuthPreauthorize a credit card which must be subsequently captured for settlement.CreditPreAuthCaptureByRecordNoTo capture previously processed EMVPreAuth transaction and add to the current batch.CreditEMVReturnEMV Return transaction.Credit or DebitEMVVoidReturnVoid a previously completed Return processed as Credit or Interac Debit. Voiding a return processed as debit is only supported in CanadaCredit or DebitReturnByRecordNoProcess an EMV Return transaction without a card present.CreditVoidReturnByRecordNoVoid of a previously completed EMV Return transaction using transaction reference identifier(s).CreditEMVZeroAuthVerify a card is valid without charging any amount.CreditPrePaid TransactionsDefinitionPrePaid EMVIssueIssue a new prepaid (stored value) card with a starting balance (value).PrePaid EMVVoidIssueVoid the previous issue a new prepaid (stored value) card with a starting balance (value).PrePaid EMVSaleProcess a payment (purchase) using a prepaid card. PrePaid sales reduce the available balance (value) of the account (card).PrePaid EMVVoidSaleVoid a previous a payment (purchase) on a prepaid card. PrePaid void sales increase the available balance (value) of the account (card).PrePaid EMVReturnProcess a return (refund) using a prepaid card. PrePaid returns increase the available balance (value) of the account (card).PrePaid EMVVoidReturnVoid a previous a return (refund) on a prepaid card. PrePaid void returns decrease the available balance (value) of the account (card).PrePaid EMVCashOutProcess a cash refund of the remaining balance on a prepaid card. A CashOut reduces the available balance (value) of the account (card) to zero.PrePaid EMVBalanceFind the remaining balance (value) on a prepaid card.Admin TransactionsDefinitionEMVParamDownloadTo download required parameters and security information to the DC Direct device.BatchSummaryRetrieves current batch summary information (overall counts and net amount; optionally totals by card type).BatchCloseTo close the currently open batch.Other OperationsDefinitionGetZipCodeTo prompt customer to enter zip code on DC Direct device.GetPhoneNumberTo prompt customer for phone number on DC Direct device.GetYesNoCustom two choice prompt to customer on DC Direct device.GetGenericAmountTo prompt customer to enter amount outside of transaction flow.GetManualTipTo prompt customer to manually enter tip amount outside of transaction flow.GetMultipleChoiceCustom multi choice prompt, max 6 choices.PrintReceiptPrint a receipt on DC Direct device with built-in receipt printer (PAX A920).GetSignatureObtain a digital signature from DC Direct device.SetTermsTo set terms and conditions on DC Direct device.DisplayTermsTo display terms and conditions on a signature capture PIN pad for customers to accept or decline.DisplayOnDeviceTo display two lines of text on DC Direct device.EMV TransactionsEMVSaleTo process a payment using an EMV device. Credit and Debit transactions are supported presented as chip, contactless, MSR, and manual entry.Implementation Notes:1. To request a token, set <RecordNo> to RecordNumberRequested and <Frequency> to Recurring2. Manual card account entry with the <AcctNo> tag should only be used if the PIN pad insertion reader fails to get card account information on the first transaction attempt. The POS logic should allow the transaction to be run again with the AcctNo tag included to force a manual entry of card account information.Sample Request? Required?

Omit this tag if <RecordNo> tag is not supplied.OKAmount(String 1-24 chars)When the optional OKAmount tag is included with the value “Disallow”, the PIN pad will not prompt the cardholder to approve the transaction amount. When the optional OKAmount tag is included with the value “Disallow_All”, the pinpad will not prompt the cardholder to approve the transaction amount or any added gratuity or cashback amounts after selection. If the OKAmount tag is omitted, the PIN pad will ask the cardholder to approve the transaction amount by default.TranInfo:CustomerCode(String 1-17 chars)For Purchase Card Level II transactions– customer’s identifying information; such as PO number.Sample Response?

GetSignature is a separate request that could be sent at anytime to obtain a digitized signature from the customer.2. An EMVPadReset must be performed prior to GetSignature to ensure the customer’s card is removed from the DC Direct device.3. A GetSignature request allows the integrator to optionally obtain a digitized signature from the customer for paperless record keeping of receipts when using a device that support signature capture. When a response contains the <CVM> tag, the values can be one of the following:“SIGN”“PIN VERIFIED”“PIN VERIFIED AND SIGN”“NONE”If the response value for <CVM> contains either “SIGN” or “PIN VERIFIED AND SIGN”, then send the GetSignature request. The GetSignature response should be saved with an electronic copy of the receipt for that transaction to support a merchant in a charge back request. The GetSignature response data could be converted to a graphic format, such as .bmp) and included in the stored receipt image. In the absence of a CVM (when a non-EMV card is presented), a signature can still be collected except when CardType is DEBIT.4. The Signature response data is a string of up to 8192 characters and is returned as a series of “strokes” and within each stroke is a series of X,Y coordinate points. The first point of a stroke is always a “move to” position. All subsequent points within a stroke are “draw to” positions. The “end stroke point” is simply “#,#”. That would be followed by the first point of the next stroke. X and Y coordinates are separated by a comma and end with a colon.Sample Request? English?
