EBT TransactionsEBT Foodstamp EMVSaleTo process a Foodstamp payment on an EBT card. Foodstamp EBT sales require the input of a PIN (Personal Identification Number) by the cardholder into a PIN pad device which encrypts the PIN number for secure transmission to the bank’s computer for validation.Implementation Notes:1. <TranCode> should be set to EMVSale2. <TranType> should be set to EBT3. <CardType> should be set to Foodstamp4. If processing with WorldPay Core or Fiserv RapidConnect, EMV EBT is supported. In which case exclude <TranType> to support EMV EBT and MSR EBT cards.Sample Request? Required?

May be null if no user system data was supplied in the requesteWIC Use and Implementation NoteseWIC transactions are used to electronically process payments for the WIC (Women, Infants and Children) state benefits programs. Each state administering a WIC program defines the specific requirements for systems deployed in that state.An eWIC system must regularly download an updated Approved Product List (APL) file that is used as part of the transaction process to identify WIC vs. non-WIC items. The APL includes Categories and Sub-Categories of eligible items that can be used in an eWIC sale. Universal Product Codes (UPC’s) and Price Look Up (PLU) codes may also be provided in the APL and are used to identify state agency approved items available in a store for eWIC redemption.EWIC transactions are based on redeeming food quantities by specific food category. EWIC systems use the APL to determine what items in a sale are eligible for eWIC redemption at the time the eWIC tender is offered at an eWIC capable POS.An eWIC purchase transaction is a combination of two transactions: a pre-purchase balance inquiry (BalancePreVal) and a purchase (Sale). When an eWIC card is presented, the eWIC POS system must first query (Balance) the state records for the eWIC cardholder account to determine what item categories to which the account may be entitled.To process the eWIC redemption (Sale), the POS then ‘looks back’ into the items accumulated in the transaction and compares them to the APL to determine which are eligible for eWIC redemption. Then the eWIC system submits a redemption (Sale) request to determine which items will be accepted for the sale. The request contains a UPC or PLU, quantity and item price for each item to be processed in the eWIC Sale transaction.Responses for eWIC Sale and Voucher transactions may include item data with changes that differ from the request. The eWIC system must be able to adjust an eWIC redemption (Sale or Voucher) based on the response for each item since items may be denied or reduced in quantity and/or price.eWIC responses include grouped information on each of the individual requested items in the following tags:TagDescriptionUPCItem#UPC for item #PLUItem#PLU for item #ItemPrice#Actual price allowed for Item #ItemQty#Actual quantity allowed for Item #ItemStatusStatus of Item # (see below)The eWIC system must evaluate the ItemStatus values for each Item#. The following chart is a guideline outlining the actions to be taken on each Item#:ActionDescriptionApprovedItem approved at price and quantity requested.Approved for lower qtyItem approved for a lesser quantity than requested. POS should adjust eWIC sale detail as needed. POS should allow inclusion of excess item quantities in sale for alternate payment at cardholder’s discretion.Approved for lower priceItem approved for a lesser price than requested. POS should adjust eWIC sale price detail as neededDeniedItem not allowed for eWIC sale. POS should allow inclusion of items in sale for alternate payment at cardholder’s discretion.Denied CAT not prescribedItem category not prescribed for card account. POS should allow inclusion of items in sale for alternate payment at cardholder’s discretion.Denied insufficient unitsItem units insufficient. POS should allow inclusion of items in sale for alternate payment at cardholder’s discretion.Denied UPC/PLU not prescribedItem not allowed or prescribed for eWIC sale. POS should allow inclusion of items in sale for alternate payment at cardholder’s discretion.Important: Since the rules for eWIC transaction processing are defined and controlled by state governmental agencies, a developer incorporating NETePay transaction support in their POS system must contact those agencies directly to get a full understanding of the state specific eWIC program requirements.eWIC Processing Provider SupportNETePay supports two processors for eWIC transactions: Fiserv (FDMS RapidConnect) and Worldpay Core610. There are slight differences in some the transactions supported as well as the form of the requests and response data returned. These differences are noted in each transaction definition section.The following are the supported transactions for each processing service provider:ProcessorBalanceBalancePreValSaleReverseSaleVoucherFiserv (FDMS RapidConnect)?????Worldpay Core610?????BIN Lists and eWIC Terminal IDsUp to the first 8 digits of an eWIC card number are known as the Issuer Identification Number (IIN), also known as bank identification number (BIN). For eWIC cards, these are defined by the state that issues cards to the cardholders.An eWIC system must verify that a card to be used for an eWIC transaction is allowed for the state by checking the BIN before submitting transactions for processing. A terminal ID assigned by the processing service provider may also need to be associated with the BIN. The responsible state agency is the source for the applicable BIN ranges supported; the processing service provider is the source for the Terminal IDs.NETePay eWIC transaction requests include a tag, EWICBins, where the allowed card BIN ranges and Terminal IDs are supplied for verification by the processing service provider. The EWICBins tag must be included in every eWIC transaction request.The format of the data for EWICBins tag is processor dependent as follows:ProcessorTemplateExampleFiserv (FDMS RapidConnect)<EWICBins>binvalue,binvalue,binvalue,(etc)<EWICBins><EWICBins>610348,944111,633555</EWICBins>Worldpay Core610<EWICBins>binvalue:terminalid,binvalue:terminalid,(etc)<EWICBins><EWICBins>610348:711293,944111:711294,633555:711295</EWICBins>eWIC BalanceThe eWIC Balance is processed to get the balance for customer’s card on demand from eWIC processor.Implementation Notes1. eWIC Balance is not the same as BalancePreVal. A BalancePreVal, must precede an eWIC Sale.Sample Request? xml?POST /ProcessEMVTransaction/ HTTP/1.1Host: 192.168.1.232:8080Content-Type: application/xmlContent-Length: 317<?xml version="1.0" ?><TStream>    <Transaction>        <MerchantID>DEMODCHALGP</MerchantID>        <UserTrace>Dev1</UserTrace>        <POSPackageID>PyTest:2.0</POSPackageID>        <TranCode>EMVBalance</TranCode>        <SecureDevice>CloudEMV2</SecureDevice>        <RefNo>1304126833</RefNo>        <InvoiceNo>1304126833</InvoiceNo>        <SequenceNo>0010010010</SequenceNo>        <OperatorID>001</OperatorID>        <ReturnClearExpDate>Allow</ReturnClearExpDate>        <ReturnClearCardBin>Allow</ReturnClearCardBin>        <Duplicate>None</Duplicate>        <Account>            <AcctNo>SecureDevice</AcctNo>        </Account>        <Amount>            <Purchase>0.00</Purchase>        </Amount>        <RecordNo>RecordNumberRequested</RecordNo>        <Frequency>OneTime</Frequency>        <PartialAuth>Allow</PartialAuth>        <TranType>EBT</TranType>        <CardType>EWIC</CardType>        <EWICBins>476173,507680,610296</EWICBins>        <TranDeviceID>2620031556</TranDeviceID>    </Transaction></TStream>?MerchantID(String 1-24 chars)RequiredMerchant identification assigned by gateway or processor.UserTrace(String 1-40 chars)A unique value created and supplied by POS system.POSPackageID(String 1-99 chars)RequiredInclude this tag with POS package name and version where the name and version are separated with a colon (“:”).
