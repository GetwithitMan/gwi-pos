No Datacap hardware or software is necessary. The POS simply initiates a request through an HTTP or HTTPS POST and DC Direct captures customer cardholder data and securely sends it to Datacap’s NETePay Hosted platform. DC Direct offers an optional Standalone non-integrated mode for use cases which require a Standalone payment terminal.How DC Direct worksOnce connected to the internet, the DC Direct device is ready to receive payment requests from the POS. The POS terminal communicates over the local, in-store network to the DC Direct device using an HTTP request. The DC Direct device prompts the customer for payment, collects cardholder data, and makes an outgoing HTTPS request to NETePay Hosted. From there, the request is routed to a backend processor for authorization, and the response flows back to the POS terminal.DC Direct supports two communication methods: Local and Server POST. Local POST allows for local communication to DC Direct via HTTP POST with Store and Forward capabilities. Server POST allows for communication via HTTPS POST to our cloud environment.To configure DC Direct:1. Connect PIN pad to data and power source using included cables (varies by device model)2. Initiate DC Direct parameter download through PIN pad (varies by device manufacturer)3. Identify PIN pad IP address using Device Discovery (optional for local communication only)4. Process paymentsFor server communication to the pad it is important to note communication between the service and device is done on TCP port 5080, so any installations need to make sure that port is open in their firewall.Refer to the DC Direct set-up guide for PIN pad specific set-up instructions.DC Direct StandaloneDC Direct has an optional Standalone mode. Standalone is non-integrated and allows the merchant to take payments by manually entering transactions on the payment device. Toggle between Semi-integrated and Standalone mode on demand.DC Direct Standalone is supported on the following payment devices:PAX AndroidIngenico AXIUMA920 ProEX8000A920 MaxEX6000A77EX4000A6650DX8000A800DX4000Standalone Supported TrancodesEMVParamDownloadEMVSaleEMVPreAuthEMVReturnEMVZeroAuthEMVIssueEMVVoidIssueEMVBalanceVoidSaleByRecordNoAdjustByRecordNoPreAuthCaptureByRecordNoVoidReturnByRecordNoPrintReceiptSee support documentation for Standalone configuration: DC Direct Standalone Quick Reference GuideLocal Device Discovery (Local Communication)The Device Discovery technique provides a way for the POS terminal to locate the DC Direct device on the local network via UDP broadcast. The POS broadcasts the message “Who has DEVICE SN” to the local network on port 9001, where DEVICE SN is the device serial number located underneath the PIN pad. If the broadcast is picked up by the DC Direct device, it responds with “DEVICE SN is at:192.168.0.21” (where DEVICE SN is the device serial number and 192.168.0.21 is its local IP address). Because UDP is a connectionless protocol which does not guarantee delivery, we suggest broadcasting the discovery message up to 30 times with 500ms delays between while listening for a response.See example C# sample code, or contact Integration Support for further examples.? csharp?static void Main(string[] args){    int port = 9001;    var deviceID = "183567303261086003685327";    System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient udpClient = new System.Net.Sockets.UdpClient();    System.Net.IPEndPoint groupEP = new System.Net.IPEndPoint(System.Net.IPAddress.Any, port);    // Listen     var listener = Task.Run(() =>    {        while (true)        {            byte[] recvBuffer = udpClient.Receive(ref groupEP);            var resp = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(recvBuffer);            if (resp.Contains(deviceID + " is at:"))                Console.WriteLine("Found DC Direct at: " + resp.Substring(resp.IndexOf(':')+1));        }    });    // Broadcast    var data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Who has " + deviceID);    udpClient.Send(data, data.Length, "255.255.255.255", port);    listener.Wait(5000);   // wait 5 seconds for response    Console.ReadLine();}?PamiPOP and DC DirectDC Direct is also compatible with the PamiPOP Terminal from PamiTV. PamiPOP uses the ID TECH VP3350 to accept payments and is available in multiple screen sizes — 10?, 15?, 21?, and 27?— featuring vibrant MicroTouch touch screen displays. With ad-subsidized hardware and built-in revenue streams for ISVs and merchants, PamiPOP helps merchants cut costs and gives ISVs a new way to deliver added value including free ad space for merchants.Note PamiPOP is only supported with DC Direct local POST communication.PamiPOP Supported TransactionsThe following transactions are supported with PamiPOP and DC Direct:PamiPOP and DC Direct supported transactionsEMVSale (Credit Only)EMVVoidSaleVoidSaleByRecordNoEMVReturn (Credit Only)EMVVoidReturnVoidReturnByRecordNoEMVVoiceAuthEMVPreAuthIncrementalAuthByRecordNoPartialReversalByRecordNoPreAuthCaptureByRecordNoAdjustByRecordNoSaleByRecordNoReturnByRecordNoStore and Forward (offline processing)Note Fleet is not supported with PamiPOP and DC DirectBasic PamiPOP ConfigurationTo configure PamiPOP:1. Mount the PamiPOP Terminal to the counter.2. Ensure the ID TECH VP3350 is mounted to the PamiPOP Terminal.3. Power up the PamiPOP unit and connect to the desired network.4. Once the device is powered on, follow the on-screen setup process.Refer to the DC Direct set-up guide for PamiPOP specific set-up instructions.Datacap Splash Screen guideDatacap partners can replace the default Datacap DC Direct “splash screen” or “welcome screen” with their own brand or merchant branding.
