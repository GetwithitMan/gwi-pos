Admin Requests
AcquireInitialApiKey - V2 Only
To acquire an initial API Key and switch your MID from V1 to V2 authentication. Uses V1 authentication. This can also be used after resetting an API Key through PSCS.
POST /V2/Admin/AcquireInitialApiKey
Implementation Notes:
1. Can only be performed once per deployment, subsequent requests to roll the token should use AcquireApiKey.
2. If ApiKey is lost, manual reset can be performed in the deployment file for the given merchant.
