What is Reporting API?
Datacap’s reporting API allows partners to build custom reporting solutions for all transactions (credit/debit/prepaid/eCommerce) utilizing Datacap interfaces via NETePay Hosted™.
Alternatively, you can use Datacap’s Reportal dashboard for all your reporting needs. To use, Datacap’s reporting dashboard, login to Datacap’s Reportal.
Datacap’s Reportal is also white-label ready. Submit company assets here to white-label Datacap’s Reportal.

Enrolled Account Statuses
Status Message
	Definition
	Card Updated
	The card’s Primary Account Number (PAN) or other account details have changed. This can be due to a new account creation, a lost or stolen card, a cardholder upgrade (e.g., to Platinum), or a portfolio change (e.g., the card was moved from one bank to another).
	Expiration Updated
	The card’s expiration date has been updated, but the Primary Account Number (PAN) remains the same.
	Payment Method Closed
	The cardholder’s account has been permanently closed and is no longer active.
	Contact Card Holder
	The issuer determines that the merchant should reach out directly to the cardholder for updated account information.
	Card Non-Participating
	The card’s BIN (the first 6-8 digits) is not part of the Account Updater service.
	Card Unknown
	The card is from a participating BIN, but the network could not find a match at this time.
	Card Enrolled
	A card is successfully enrolled in the Account Updater service. It also serves as a “no change” notification, confirming that the stored PAN and expiration date are still correct.
	Card Opt Out
	The cardholder has chosen not to participate in the Account Updater service.
	Card Enrollment Failed
	The card could not be registered with the Account Updater service.
